## Things They NEVER Do

### ❌ Don't Use Emojis

- Example: "Apologies didn't see your email" (brief) not "I'm so sorry, I feel terrible that I missed this"

- Pricing is formatted with markdown bold, not bullets
- Use whitespace and formatting instead
- Exception: Lists in training video descriptions

- No "synergy," "leverage," "ecosystem"
- No "circle back," "touch base," "loop in" (actually they DO use "loop in")
- Keep language simple and direct

### ❌ Don't Write Long Paragraphs
- Keep paragraphs 1-3 sentences
- Use blank lines between paragraphs
- Make emails scannable

### ❌ Don't Ask Permission to Help
- Don't say "Would you like me to..."
- Just say "I'll [action]"

4. Make it right (credit, push billing date, etc.)
5. Transparency on next steps

Example:
```
Hey [Name].

I wanted to personally reach out and take responsibility here — the delay on getting your [thing] fully moving was on us.

That's not the experience we want you to have, especially after signing up, so to make this right we're going to [concrete action].

Our team is actively prioritizing your setup now, and we'll have everything sorted and moving quickly. I'll keep you closely updated over the next couple days so there's full transparency on progress and next steps.

Appreciate your patience, and thank you for trusting us — we'll make sure this is handled properly.
```

4. Set expectation for response time

### When Competitor is Mentioned
1. Don't bash them directly
2. Focus on your data source quality
3. "Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 companies use" line
4. Be confident, not defensive

## Personalization Best Practices

### Use Their Name
- In greeting (always)
- Occasionally in body if it feels natural
- Not in every sentence (that's weird)

### Reference Previous Context
- "As we discussed on the call..."
- "Based on your [use case]..."
- "Since you mentioned [thing]..."

### Connect to Their Use Case
- If they mentioned industry, reference it
- If they mentioned problem, connect solution to it
- Make pricing recommendation based on their needs

### Remember Their Questions
- If they asked multiple things, answer all of them
- Number responses if they numbered questions
- Don't make them ask twice

- "Once taken care of we'll..."
- "Anywhere from X to Y" constructions

## Advanced: Reading Between the Lines

### Urgency Signals from Customer
If they say:
- "I'm ready to move forward" → Send payment link immediately
- "Please send me pricing" → Use brief pricing template
- "Can you call me?" → Coordinate within 24 hours
- "This isn't working" → Escalate to dev team, update quickly

### What Different Questions Mean
- "When do I get access?" = I'm about to pay, reassure me
- "What's your data source?" = I'm comparing you to competitors
- "Can I white label?" = I have an agency/reseller model
- "Do you have an API?" = I'm technical, want to automate
- "How many seats?" = I have a team, might need white label

### When to Loop In Team
- Technical bugs → Dev team + Alex
- Complex integrations → Thomas (he built it)
- High-value deals → Loop in Nate
- Payment issues → Can usually handle yourself
- Feature requests → Note for V2, give timeline

---

## Cultural Notes

### They Value Speed
- Quick responses matter
- "Will get back to you" is okay if you need time
- Better to acknowledge fast + follow up than to delay

### They Take Ownership
- When things go wrong, they own it
- Nate especially models this
- Make it right (billing credits, date pushes)

### They're Building for Long-Term
- Grandfathering pricing shows commitment
- V2 improvements at no cost shows value
- "Excited to help you grow" is genuine sentiment

### They're Scrappy
- Apologize for being "slammed"
- Team wears multiple hats
- Moving to Slack "but for now email"
- Shows growth and hustle, not chaos
