*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single family residential construction companies in the USA* - Watch Video <https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this process!

*Creating Targeted Audiences for Pest Control Marketing 📊* - Watch Video <https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6>

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000 records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if you have any questions!

- Product clarification needed

### Template

```
Hi [FIRST_NAME]!

[EXPLANATION OF FEATURE]

For example, [SPECIFIC EXAMPLE]


[SIGNATURE]
```

### Example

Hi Scott!

That score category is based on intent signals we are seeing for that visitor, and we have a new algorithm that deciphers how much intent there actually is.
For example, a user that lands on this page would be deemed as high intent for refinancing:
https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/refinance-rates/

In our new V2 model this will become be a numerical score 0-100

## Template 7: Data Quality / Competitive Comparison

### When to Use
- Customer asks about competitor claims
- Data quality questions
- Database size comparisons

### Template

```
Ya the biggest issue in the data space is basically just everyone saying they are better. Most people aren't being truthful for the most part. [IF SPECIFIC COMPETITOR:] Have no clue who [COMPETITOR_NAME] is. My guess is they are a whitelabel of someone else's platform.

All I can say is our base layer data source is the same provider that the Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 companies use. Even with unlimited funds there is no better provider available on the market.


Thanks
[SENDER_NAME]
```

### Variables to Replace
- `[COMPETITOR_NAME]` - If they mention specific competitor
- `[SENDER_NAME]` - Cindy, Nate, etc.

### Example

```

### When to Use

### Template

```
Hey [FIRST_NAME].

I wanted to personally reach out and take responsibility here — the delay on getting your [white-label setup/account/feature] fully moving was on us.

That's not the experience we want you to have, especially after signing up, so to make this right we're going to push your billing date back and make sure you're only billed once everything is fully live and delivered as promised.

Our team is actively prioritizing your setup now, and we'll have everything sorted and moving quickly. I'll keep you closely updated over the next couple days so there's full transparency on progress and next steps.

Appreciate your patience, and thank you for trusting us — we'll make sure this is handled properly.

[IF TEAM COORDINATION NEEDED:]
If you can when replying in this email thread ensure you reply all so [TEAM_MEMBERS] can see it also.

[TEAM_MEMBER] will be able to answer any questions as he's the one that built the tool.


Best,
Nate
```

### Variables to Replace
- `[FIRST_NAME]` - Customer's first name
- `[white-label setup/account/feature]` - Specific issue
- `[TEAM_MEMBERS]` - Names of people to CC
- `[TEAM_MEMBER]` - Primary support person

### Example
