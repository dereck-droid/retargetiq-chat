## Transcript

**Robert:** Of good covers.
**Robert:** So good to see cover arts making a living here.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** I've got my.
**Jon Kluger:** I've got a four foot long Pink Floyd Dark side of the Moon coaster downstairs.

**Robert:** How do you make you make these?

**Jon Kluger:** So I do make similar ones, but these are official band prints.
**Jon Kluger:** I have my own, ironically, I have my own website where I make my own band prints and merchandise as well.
**Jon Kluger:** That's just.

**Robert:** Check it out, man.
**Robert:** Yeah, send it to me.
**Robert:** So I have it.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So here.
**Jon Kluger:** Fun fact.
**Jon Kluger:** I use AI that I've developed myself to make all designs.

**Robert:** Beautiful.
**Robert:** Very cool.
**Robert:** So my deal is I have a small agency.
**Robert:** I use Audience Labs right now.
**Robert:** So I'm just interesting how retarget IQ could kind of compete with that because it's very expensive.

**Jon Kluger:** 100% could.
**Jon Kluger:** If you don't mind me asking, could I get a little bit better of an idea of the current package that you're with in terms of.

**Robert:** I had the Mac daddy package, just 2500 bucks plus all the trimmings.
**Robert:** And my main field is healthcare.
**Robert:** Medical med, spas, travel.
**Robert:** Med travel.
**Robert:** I mean we do very advanced longevity protocols.
**Robert:** We're the guys like Brian Johnson and this kind of thing.
**Robert:** We do a lot of things with very advanced medicine stem cells, having people, you know, take care of themselves better, that kind of thing.

**Jon Kluger:** That's fantastic.
**Jon Kluger:** Actually, one of our co founders, Alex, who couldn't do join us today, he was on the phone with the lawyers and you know how those conversations go when they build by the hour.
**Jon Kluger:** They always want to drag it out.
**Jon Kluger:** But he, he actually used to run a marketing agency that focused on med spots.
**Jon Kluger:** So he was actually one of the reasons that we started as a company was he met our technical co founder, saw the, saw the technology and essentially what it was able to do.
**Jon Kluger:** It was incredibly helpful for him in his business.
**Jon Kluger:** And then he was like, you know what?
**Jon Kluger:** This tool is even more powerful than anything else that I'm on.
**Jon Kluger:** Like I want to be able to put together something that can be used like marketers like me.
**Jon Kluger:** So in terms of your use case, it's a perfect fit.

**Robert:** In terms then also, besides bringing them leads and helping them with, you know, converting people in that way, we also have a software product that we saw under the name Ever better you would like to know about.
**Robert:** So everbetter.com it's a different company than what I reached out to you for, but I probably plan on selling that to med spas and other groups.
**Robert:** Has a, what you call an EHR system, medical record system.
**Robert:** It's a very advanced system.
**Robert:** I teamed with the guy that founded the World Wide Web Teamers, Lee.
**Robert:** He invented the World Wide web and a lot of stuff.
**Robert:** And so we're pretty much in the space of health data sovereignty, if you will.
**Robert:** So that's kind of my.
**Robert:** That's my big thing.
**Robert:** But yeah.
**Robert:** So Audience Lab is expensive.
**Robert:** It's also cumbersome.
**Robert:** You get so much data and so much stuff coming to you.
**Robert:** I have all the scripts of all the stuff.
**Robert:** It's just a lot.
**Robert:** So I need something a little more turnkey without sacrificing some of the value that it brings.
**Robert:** I like their Super Pixel.
**Robert:** I like the, you know, all the studio stuff you get.
**Robert:** I also use instantly with it.
**Robert:** I like instantly all the other things.
**Robert:** I don't know what else you guys recommend, but instantly does a lot of good for me.
**Robert:** I'm also a domainer on the side.
**Robert:** I got a lot of AI domains.
**Robert:** I'm broken right now.
**Robert:** $2 million worth.
**Robert:** And so I just need to find domainers all day long and it's easy with Insulin I can do whatever I need to do.
**Robert:** It's the one thing Audience Labs, I like their Super Pixel because they enrich the data, but it's not that hard to do anymore.
**Robert:** I mean there's enrichment.
**Robert:** There's an enrichment.
**Robert:** Right.
**Robert:** There's like segment which I like and we use in some of our clients.
**Robert:** Right.
**Robert:** But it's very, very expensive.
**Robert:** So it could be 10,000 bucks a month.

**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** So I think we are going to be a fantastic option for you.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for it.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry, my Alex was just messaging me making sure that we were able to connect and I just wanted to let him know we are not only including the Super Pixel in our package free of charge or value added included.
**Jon Kluger:** We allow for unlimited audience building and we allow for unlimited updates.
**Jon Kluger:** We allow for unlimited lead list size.
**Jon Kluger:** I know you want to be more granular, but just in the grand scheme of things you can.
**Jon Kluger:** You are free to go into the platform and test any audience, build any audience, do whatever you'd like.
**Jon Kluger:** You're not confined to the 2, 4.

**Robert:** Give me a little.
**Robert:** Give me a 24 hour login or a temp login or something.

**Jon Kluger:** Legally, our data partners do not allow for us to do that.
**Jon Kluger:** What I can do is we'll pull five queries together on this call and I'll actually show you the actual results because we can get your results in a matter of 30 seconds.

**Robert:** Yeah, let's do that.

**Jon Kluger:** We can do that.

**Robert:** Sounds good.
**Robert:** Now then, I can understand your data sets.
**Robert:** What's that?

**Jon Kluger:** Just for my understanding in regards to your current plan with Audience Lab, do you have your clients enter the portal and work directly in as a white.

**Robert:** Label experience, I can, but I like to run it all for them.

**Jon Kluger:** We.

**Robert:** We have a thing with dude ranches that we like and these guys are just dude ranch dudes.

**Jon Kluger:** I mean reason, the reason I asked it transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** We are about to demo you V1.
**Jon Kluger:** V2 comes out February 14th.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to be a lot sexier, it'll be a lot cleaner.
**Jon Kluger:** There'll be additional integrations and there'll be the option for you to add additional direct integrations within the platform.
**Jon Kluger:** What I mean by that is in its current state, from the sounds of it, you only need one license from us.
**Jon Kluger:** With that one license, currently we only have the ability to integrate into a single CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** In V2, which goes live February 15th, you'll be able to connect to additional CRMs as well.

**Robert:** Good.
**Robert:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Just want to be transparent there.

**Robert:** Right now I'm just using sheets.
**Robert:** Let me take it into HubSpot or go hey level, whatever they like.
**Robert:** But I said go into sheets and I run it for them that way.
**Robert:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** So like right now we do have direct integrations in Go High Level and HubSpot.
**Jon Kluger:** We're adding the Google sheets, direct integration as well as another 10 by February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that is this will allow for you to essentially be a one stop shop for all data you can be.

**Robert:** I like to be that for people.
**Robert:** Just even if I give it to them, they still don't use it.
**Robert:** It's kind of just a data swarm out here.
**Robert:** So you try to keep it organized inherently.
**Robert:** So no sheets yet, huh?

**Jon Kluger:** So we don't tap on seats.
**Jon Kluger:** What we look at is if you're doing white labeling and you want to create an individualized instance for each client where they live inside of where they can't see any of the work you do with any of your other clients.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what we consider separate licenses under a white label.
**Jon Kluger:** For what you need, it sounds like is you only need to be from one person.

**Robert:** I need the one.
**Robert:** And I brokered the data out.
**Robert:** I managed the data for them actually.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.
**Jon Kluger:** So you only need one seat, which starts at $500 a month just for reference.

**Robert:** That's amazing.
**Robert:** And I get unlimited.
**Robert:** And so the one thing I like, everyone's kind of doing it.
**Robert:** No one really does this well as segment.
**Robert:** So that's the MacDaddy version or other.
**Robert:** You know CDs, if you will.
**Robert:** Which this is not as moving in that direction is I can actually see the customer journey.
**Robert:** So I know why they entered the site.
**Robert:** You can get that pretty easily where they go on the site and what visits they have on the site.
**Robert:** That's what I like about the Super Pick.
**Robert:** So I can actually see their journey to a degree.
**Robert:** I know my source, what they, what they liked about the source, and I can see what they visit, even how many times they visit instantly kind of has it because you can't download it.
**Robert:** They're.
**Robert:** They're working on that.
**Robert:** So it's a, it's a brave new world, man, you know.

**Jon Kluger:** Fantastic.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, no, we'll definitely be a, a great, a great fit.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is we include five super pixels with every single single license.
**Jon Kluger:** So right off the bat, you pay us 500amonth in the quarterly plan.
**Jon Kluger:** You have unlimited visitor identification for every single pixel of the first five.
**Jon Kluger:** Any additional after that is just $50.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you want to add another 10 pixels, you're more than welcome to.

**Robert:** And you pixel per client.

**Jon Kluger:** I, I typically recommend one pixel per client because it sticks to the domain and the subdomains.
**Jon Kluger:** But if a client has, say four different websites, you're going to want to put a pixel on each of the websites.

**Robert:** So.
**Robert:** Okay, so.
**Robert:** And I can see why they entered us and what they looked at and all that happy stuff.

**Jon Kluger:** So like this is the analytics in v1.
**Jon Kluger:** The analytics in v2 is going to be a lot more extensive.
**Jon Kluger:** So this is just on the overall website.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're looking at which pages have the most views, who was viewing them, the demographic breakdowns and the traffic source that are associated with them.
**Jon Kluger:** Then if you wanted to actually identify them and look at them in a deeper, more granular level, you can see right here, we'll identify the people, their address, the source.
**Jon Kluger:** We scroll over to the right, we monitor user path and we even can pull up their distinct financial.

**Robert:** How many of that?
**Robert:** So basically when I do my download, I can see like the net worth, their supposed salary, all that happy stuff.

**Jon Kluger:** Everything will be included except in the export, except for the behaviors, because that will be data overload.
**Jon Kluger:** If you can't tell, look how much behaviors is captured for behavior.
**Jon Kluger:** Behavior is essentially what directly correlates to intent.

**Robert:** I can't download that.

**Jon Kluger:** You can download.
**Jon Kluger:** You can sort and pull up intent.
**Jon Kluger:** But pulling this amount of data for every single export creates just chaos.
**Jon Kluger:** And we've noticed that.

**Robert:** Dude, there's 84 fields, okay.
**Robert:** In audience lab 84 friggin fields we only find.
**Robert:** We need about 1512-15.
**Robert:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I'm saying is you're able to pull everything on this on visitor.
**Jon Kluger:** We just don't want to give you a thousand lines of what behavior we've picked up on.
**Jon Kluger:** But if you go over here and build it, you can build it based on intent so you can pull specific to behaviors that you want.
**Jon Kluger:** We're just.

**Robert:** Interesting.
**Robert:** Check it out now.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** On our export we've just noticed like we've had people who are doing visitors and they have 10,000 visitors in a single day to their website.
**Jon Kluger:** And then we pull the behaviors and it's a multi gigabyte file and they're like this is too much.

**Robert:** You can have like 800,000 data points or something.
**Robert:** It's just ridiculous.
**Robert:** I'm with you on that.
**Robert:** That's what I like about audience levels.
**Robert:** I can pick and choose those.
**Robert:** I write scripts for those so they know exactly what I like.
**Robert:** I run the script, I do the whole thing.
**Robert:** But it's still just semi automated.
**Robert:** I need to automate whatever I do.
**Robert:** Also just be a crazy man.

**Jon Kluger:** No, that makes sense.
**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** So we can go ahead and build an example for B2C.
**Jon Kluger:** Do your meds.
**Jon Kluger:** Was do a zembic.

**Robert:** Yeah.
**Robert:** You could do a simple.
**Robert:** Let's do this.
**Robert:** Let's see something more exotic.
**Robert:** I do something called plasmapheresis which is blood transfusion.
**Robert:** And you'll get some stuff.
**Robert:** Watch this plasma phoresis.

**Jon Kluger:** So we.
**Jon Kluger:** So right now in V1 we have specific intent categories that were stuck to.
**Jon Kluger:** So we have 42000 in V2 that goes live February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** You can freeform and write anything you want in it.

**Robert:** It's kind of keyword.
**Robert:** Do stem cells.
**Robert:** It's frigging broad.
**Robert:** Right?

**Jon Kluger:** Stem cell therapy.

**Robert:** Yep.

**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** Now we look at only two weeks of intent data.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is we've determined after countless experience that if someone's been showing buying signals consistently for two weeks, they're likely to have made the purchase or committed to a cl like to make the purchase from a specific vendor.
**Jon Kluger:** So we don't like to look beyond the two weeks because we personally think if you're paying to run ads or if you're paying audiences.

**Robert:** 10 days just in our audience lab is 10 days for your record.
**Robert:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** So we just.
**Jon Kluger:** We look at it for.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll do it as a comparison.
**Jon Kluger:** So for.
**Jon Kluger:** That's 14 to 10.
**Jon Kluger:** Well technically that's.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, that sounds perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** And then do you have A specific geolocation.

**Robert:** Take me to Tennessee.
**Robert:** Nashville, Tennessee.

**Jon Kluger:** So much.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, I spelled that right.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry.
**Jon Kluger:** Sometimes I worry myself.
**Jon Kluger:** Is there a specific age, income or.

**Robert:** Yeah, more high income.
**Robert:** We like the highest income.
**Robert:** So anything over like in terms of income, let's just say 6.

**Jon Kluger:** Anything over 100k, we can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** Then we'll go ahead and hit build audience.

**Robert:** And what about net worth?
**Robert:** How do you do a net worth?

**Jon Kluger:** Net worth is just a combination of income and we also look at property value and vehicle value to do a fair estimate of net worth.

**Robert:** Gotcha.
**Robert:** And you do that.

**Jon Kluger:** So right now.

**Robert:** It'S good that you have that because obviously real estate, luxury real estate.
**Robert:** So it was a good market for me.

**Jon Kluger:** So right now in terms of in Nashville in the last 10 days we, we see about 179 people that have specifically been looking for stem cell therapy.

**Robert:** Love it.

**Jon Kluger:** Making over a hundred thousand dollars.

**Robert:** Yeah, that's beauty man.

**Jon Kluger:** So what you'll see over here too is the net worth for most of these people seem to align with that.
**Jon Kluger:** What I imagine say this instance of this person right here who's in the negative, I imagine they probably took a loan out on a home and something like that.
**Jon Kluger:** Their net worth is negative because they.

**Robert:** The mortgage second or third on the house or whatever.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.

**Robert:** Something to me.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** If we are to scroll over, you'll see personal information on the left and then on the right side it's going to be more business.
**Jon Kluger:** What's really nice for you is if you hit download all say stem cell therapy, Nashville sources.

**Robert:** Where are you guys getting your data from?
**Robert:** Like Quora Medium.

**Jon Kluger:** So we're one of five people in the world that have less than five people in the world that have access to the data platform that we initially use as a core data set.
**Jon Kluger:** It's a publicly, I can't say it by name, but it's a publicly traded company.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we can tell you officially that none of our competitors, Audience Lab, ZoomInfo, Apollo IO, any of them have access to this data set as it typically costs upwards of six figures every single month to even start getting your foot in the door.
**Jon Kluger:** The whole reason get access to.
**Jon Kluger:** What's your story?
**Jon Kluger:** What's the origin story with you?
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** So the origin story of the platform is our technical co founder Thomas has been working with Fortune 100 companies in this data partner for well over 15 years.
**Jon Kluger:** Through that he essentially created a well fleshed out query based SQL data lake where he was leveraging not only this core data set, but an additional 200 data sets.
**Jon Kluger:** That waterfall enrich the gaps within the main data set.

**Robert:** That's just like Sigma, man.
**Robert:** That's what they do.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** So what he eventually did was after spending 15 years working directly with this company, he was able to gardener a license to essentially be able to leverage their data and then resell it.
**Jon Kluger:** As long as we don't directly like go after their customers, of course.

**Robert:** And all of that as well.
**Robert:** As well as what's the last part?

**Jon Kluger:** They.
**Jon Kluger:** They allow for us to then be able to resell their data as long as we aren't technically going after like their customers and being like, hey, we can sell you their data.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, basically, as long as we're not screwing over our data provider.
**Jon Kluger:** We're one of less than five people in the world that have access to their data.
**Jon Kluger:** And this is the data that's used by Fortune 100 companies, almost every single one.
**Jon Kluger:** Clean interface too.

**Robert:** I like the interface a lot.

**Jon Kluger:** It's going to get even cleaner in the new one in the update where we're making the.

**Robert:** That's my birthday, man.
**Robert:** February 15th.
**Robert:** It's a good day.

**Jon Kluger:** Wonderful.
**Jon Kluger:** It sounds like a great present for your birthday.

**Robert:** It's a good day, baby.

**Jon Kluger:** I have.
**Jon Kluger:** I haven't even.
**Jon Kluger:** Another exciting element is.
**Jon Kluger:** So what we can do, by the.

**Robert:** Way, I want to see.
**Robert:** Show me like anything about how they originated, how they got here.
**Robert:** It's a secret in terms of what they searched on.

**Jon Kluger:** So in terms of the individual person's journey, when you query it in the audience builder, it doesn't necessarily boil it down to their exact journey.
**Jon Kluger:** What I can confidently tell you is what we do a little bit different than our peers is we're very selective in terms of how we discover and determine intent.
**Jon Kluger:** What I like to tell people is a lot of people will do low level intent.
**Jon Kluger:** If we're doing a grading scale like from school, they'll say a low level intent is like a C minus a medium level intent is like a B and a high level intent is like an A.
**Jon Kluger:** That's not how we operate.
**Jon Kluger:** We look at low level intent as a B because we want to make sure we're actually capturing high engagement intent.
**Jon Kluger:** I always joke, so I gave my phone to my nephew to go watch Coco Melon, a kid show.
**Jon Kluger:** I am not showing intent for Cocomelon.
**Jon Kluger:** So all of a sudden are they spending money on sending me ads?
**Jon Kluger:** Seems like a waste in ad spend.
**Jon Kluger:** So that being said, what we've determined it is, I always say is a low level intent is a B.
**Jon Kluger:** You're happy with it.
**Jon Kluger:** It's.
**Jon Kluger:** It's pretty good.
**Jon Kluger:** Like it's bad.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not average or like C, low.

**Robert:** Levels, kind of mid level.

**Jon Kluger:** Low levels of B.
**Jon Kluger:** Mid medium is like an A and then high is an A plus.
**Jon Kluger:** Hell yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Like I work with, I work with roofing companies and what I've explained to them is I go.
**Jon Kluger:** If you are working within a very small geographic location, go ahead and find the pull up of roofing intent or roof repair, rather intent.
**Jon Kluger:** Find the high level intense.
**Jon Kluger:** Go ahead, filter for that.
**Jon Kluger:** Throw in all the addresses to chat GPT and then tell it to give you a driving path and then just drive past those houses, pull up in the front, walk up and knock on the door.

**Robert:** You guys are nuts.
**Robert:** I know this is a rough way to make a living.
**Robert:** Dude.
**Robert:** No, I got you.
**Robert:** Yeah, everyone's doing it, all the kids are doing it.
**Robert:** So you gotta.

**Jon Kluger:** Well, the guy literally said he, he was like, I'm, I'm gonna go ahead and try this.
**Jon Kluger:** And a week later he texted me and he's like, I went to the first high level intent, knocked on the door, said I was doing work in the neighborhood, noticed a few shingles missing.
**Jon Kluger:** Could I give him.

**Robert:** Oh my freaking God.

**Jon Kluger:** I told him to get up on the roof.

**Robert:** Okay, I'm a little bit more esoteric.
**Robert:** So let me go with me.
**Robert:** Roofing is not my gig.
**Robert:** I'm more of a very high end guy.
**Robert:** You don't know me.
**Robert:** I don't really know who I am.
**Robert:** I'll be your guy.
**Robert:** You're Thomas.
**Robert:** I'll probably know Thomas.
**Robert:** So here's the deal.
**Robert:** I'm also interested in CEO coaching.
**Robert:** I need CEOs.
**Robert:** I want my level of coaching.
**Robert:** So I'd say it's very bespoke, almost like optimizing a CEO.
**Robert:** How would I find CEOs would be interested in kind of one on one?

**Jon Kluger:** We can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** Just let me show you one last thing that I like to highlight.
**Jon Kluger:** So that query we just ran, we can select here to schedule it to refresh every single day with the same.

**Robert:** We need to do that 100% of course.

**Jon Kluger:** And then on top of that, you can set it.

**Robert:** What do I do with the data if I can't put into sheets?
**Robert:** I just.
**Robert:** It's a download.
**Robert:** And what do I do with the data then?

**Jon Kluger:** It's.
**Jon Kluger:** It's up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** You can download it, you can send it direct to ad accounts, you can connect it.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have your own CRM, you're welcome to connect it into Your own CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** Beyond that right now you can easily just download it and name the file and save the file.

**Robert:** Just put it in my instantly or something too probably.
**Robert:** What does CS recommend to interact interact with as a.
**Robert:** What I.
**Robert:** What I like to do is not work.
**Robert:** Okay.
**Robert:** I like to automate stuff and I live in Ecuador part of the time.
**Robert:** I keep buying some land in Uruguay or whatever.
**Robert:** Just a hedge to reality out here.
**Robert:** And so what I like to is automate things and kind of just let it rip.
**Robert:** And so what I like to do is take my data set, my clean data set and then pump it in my instantly when I have an automation for that and.
**Robert:** And they're usually pretty warm and just engage them.
**Robert:** Take through a lander for an offer or whatever.
**Robert:** Right.
**Robert:** So I'm not going to go door to door.
**Robert:** I'm the opposite of that.
**Robert:** I'm a high end kind of guy.
**Robert:** Also my dude rans thing for $15,000 or something.
**Robert:** Right.
**Robert:** That brings me to my executives, my retreat.
**Robert:** People I have somebody wants me to do something but people want spiritual enlightenment, this kind of thing.
**Robert:** You know.
**Robert:** You can handle all that stuff.
**Robert:** How do I.
**Robert:** What do you suggest you move them to.
**Robert:** To reach contact level with them.

**Jon Kluger:** Not are you looking to just find them or just find them while they show intent?
**Jon Kluger:** Because we can do both.

**Robert:** I like both.
**Robert:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** So if we go over to the advanced search.
**Jon Kluger:** Think of advanced search as just you choose the filters from the overall data set.
**Jon Kluger:** We pull up the actual results of the people.
**Jon Kluger:** It does not look at intent.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I mean by that is like let's say we add three fields.

**Robert:** You could see that's what they call audience.
**Robert:** Audience has that too.
**Robert:** So we like that.
**Robert:** I like both.
**Robert:** I like.
**Robert:** I like the traveler.
**Robert:** That's the high intent.
**Robert:** I like the people that are just part of this overall.

**Jon Kluger:** You would just come over to the advanced search to build a list of CEOs of XYZ industry that are making above a certain amount of money.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what you could do on advance.
**Jon Kluger:** What I would recommend is go to invent intent B2C and do like coaching.

**Robert:** There's a bunch starts if you get one.
**Robert:** Yeah.
**Robert:** Never know thrunky somebody there.

**Jon Kluger:** Then we'll go back 10 days.
**Jon Kluger:** Then on top of that we're going to do job title.
**Jon Kluger:** Actually I don't want to do job title.
**Jon Kluger:** We have a different one that I think would be better which is seniority.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll get you all C levels so you could.
**Jon Kluger:** That's fine.

**Robert:** C levels fine.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** I figured that would.
**Jon Kluger:** That would kind of encapsulate in the US or somewhere more specific.
**Jon Kluger:** The whole.
**Jon Kluger:** The whole us or just a specific.

**Robert:** Oh, I'm sorry.
**Robert:** Yeah, the US is fine.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** And do you want me to set a specific income over the six figures as well?
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Robert:** How about they go to like, 250 minimum, 300 minimum, something like that?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** We can do the.
**Jon Kluger:** At least 250,000.
**Jon Kluger:** 250,000 plus issues of limit for these systems.

**Robert:** Typically.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, I always joke it says 15 to 20 minutes.
**Jon Kluger:** That's not the case.
**Jon Kluger:** We had one really impatient customer who was like, why isn't it instant?
**Jon Kluger:** And we're like, we need at least 30 seconds.

**Robert:** And he's like, dog, the wheels are worried over here, Doug.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** You can't come and complain.

**Robert:** If you guys are cool, that's cool.

**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see is the level of intent regarding coaching.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll scroll over to the right for you.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see here on the right side I'll scroll up is the company level, their contact, their job title, the company domain, the revenue of the company as well.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to look for companies that make a certain amount of money, you can do that as well.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll see the income range and the net worth.

**Robert:** That's.
**Robert:** That's good.
**Robert:** That's great.
**Robert:** Yeah, that's money, man.
**Robert:** I love this.
**Robert:** That's very cool.

**Jon Kluger:** It's super easy.

**Robert:** In terms of get on a script and get rolling here.
**Robert:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** In terms of pricing for you, what's really beautiful right now is if you lock in before February 6th, which is our deadline for V1 pricing, you are locked in at that price.
**Jon Kluger:** So you don't have to worry about when V2 comes in.
**Jon Kluger:** The only thing that you could possibly end up having to pay more for is if you want additional pixels or when we do the additional integrations, it's going to either be 50 to 100.
**Jon Kluger:** We're figuring out noise level.

**Robert:** No, I love you guys.
**Robert:** It's.
**Robert:** You're not usury pricing.

**Jon Kluger:** I don't.

**Robert:** I can't read.
**Robert:** I'm walking right now.
**Robert:** So what Are you showing me here?

**Jon Kluger:** A single license with five pixels included with unlimited audiences and lists is $500 if you pay on a quarterly basis.
**Jon Kluger:** So $1500 you get locked in at the $500 price in perpetuity.

**Robert:** Friggin noise level man.
**Robert:** Compared to what I spent a lot of money doing.
**Robert:** Also your interface is cleaner, automations will be cleaner.
**Robert:** So that could just download and put in my instantly clean it that way and make some that way through even further.

**Jon Kluger:** Yes sir.
**Jon Kluger:** And additionally Robert, if you want to go to another level of automation, we do have API access direct to the platform where you could actually, if you are housing your information in a specific location, you could actually call our API.
**Jon Kluger:** We have some pretty extensive documentation available already on our website for the V2 and you could actually build automations within the enrichment polls, what have you.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you really want to look into automations and the next step there we can easily.
**Jon Kluger:** The API is an additional 249 for month to month quarterly on the monthly costs.

**Robert:** But you guys are priced that's smart that way more like ala cart rather than the Mac Daddy.

**Jon Kluger:** We don't program.
**Jon Kluger:** So I I spent the last nine years in the AI and data space.
**Jon Kluger:** I went to school for data analytics.
**Jon Kluger:** I've been on sales team running sales team, growing sales teams specifically oriented on data driven softwares.

**Robert:** You guys are real.
**Robert:** I mean that's the same with Adam and all the guys over there at audience lab.
**Robert:** They're pretty Mac Daddy stuff.
**Robert:** They and they and use it for your stuff which looks like album art to me which is cool.
**Robert:** Whatever you're doing.
**Robert:** You still love album art using your system here.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** We just believe in making things where data is about discovery.
**Jon Kluger:** If we put you in a box and say you can only use 8 audiences, 9 audiences, 10 on however number whatever number it is and you can only look at a certain number of leads.
**Jon Kluger:** That's not discovery like statistics is literally based off of a control group and hypothesis.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're only able to have a control group and you're stuck with that control group in perpetuity, you're not able to test, improve and expand upon your efforts.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's one of the things that I push the team internally to ensure we always have is the ability for you to constantly be able to create.

**Robert:** More hypotheses going you know I like it good.
**Robert:** So I could use this with my instantly.
**Robert:** I could download put in my instantly instantly as a little CRM too preserve that data maybe and then do my little reach out to people exactly.

**Jon Kluger:** V2 will have email validation built in as well.
**Jon Kluger:** So when you start doing those exports and we'll be able to verify the email.

**Robert:** I don't need to.
**Robert:** I mean the whole thing.
**Robert:** One thing about Audience Lab where you're paying for.

**Jon Kluger:** But this, this unique identifier will ensure that you're able to match to the proper audience.
**Jon Kluger:** That's, that's why we've been seeing so such great results is our ability to properly target with the data that we have on Meta.
