## Transcript

**Danny Armand:** All right, got this pulled up.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** All right, awesome.
**Danny Armand:** Yeah, thank you so much for taking the time.
**Danny Armand:** So just, I mean, if there's anything you want to jump into right out of the gate, I had just a bunch of questions, so.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You have your.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You have your logins, right?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Did Nate send those over to you?

**Danny Armand:** Yes.
**Danny Armand:** Let me pull that up actually.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** If you could do that and then share your screen.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I rather you share your screen.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I kind of walk you through doing everything rather than me doing it.

**Danny Armand:** Do that right now.
**Danny Armand:** Here we go.
**Danny Armand:** I'm in.
**Danny Armand:** Here you go.
**Danny Armand:** So here's this.
**Danny Armand:** Great.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Danny, real quick.
**Alex Ciereszko:** On Slack, you mentioned you said, hey, I want to be able to white label a certain part of this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And could you clarify on which part you were saying, hey, I don't want people to be able to see X, Y and Z. Yeah.

**Danny Armand:** So I was under the impression that when we white label.
**Danny Armand:** Right.
**Danny Armand:** It will look essentially like this, but with my logo at the top.
**Danny Armand:** Right?
**Danny Armand:** Is that correct?

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's correct.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Did they.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Did Nate.

**Danny Armand:** So I don't have anything like that.
**Danny Armand:** And I was confused because this.
**Danny Armand:** I just don't even know what to do here or where to go here or what this is even for.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Got it.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Go to Footer Links as an example.
**Danny Armand:** It just says create footer.
**Danny Armand:** Like, like how do I go from this dashboard to this dashboard, the actual user.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, let's go back into the back end of this one right here and then click on Users at the very bottom.
**Alex Ciereszko:** To be honest, Danny, the only thing that you're going to need to be doing is be in the user section.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm going to message Sammy here in a second to change these logos around for you on the back end.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But this is where you're actually going to add people.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you click on those three dots by the eyeball on your user and you click that shouldn't be replicate there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's because you're already logged in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's just say if you click Create User in the top right corner, right, this is going to open up exactly what you have to do to set up one of these clicks client accounts.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So the first thing you're going to do is going to say choose option, you're always going to set these people as users.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you want to hit that drop down user.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Sorry, the, the drop downs are blocked for me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I didn't see you doing that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But the name obviously going to be first and last name for a person.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I think you.

**Danny Armand:** I think you test Right now and just build this out?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Danny Armand:** Let's do it.

**Alex Ciereszko:** You can use my name, your name, whatever you want to do.

**Danny Armand:** Perfect.

**Alex Ciereszko:** And then email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Perfect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And you're going to be billing people on the back end through a payment processor, correct?
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, awesome.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you don't have to worry about bill manually, additional mail, or enable.

**Danny Armand:** What does bill manually do different than.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It used to be a feature where we could charge people through the back end.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We stopped doing that just because any sort of chargeback.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you do get a chargeback, it's very rare.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We've never had a chargeback.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We've had clients that get charged back.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we stopped doing that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But that feature is still in the Bill, Bill manually section.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But I wouldn't.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I wouldn't worry about that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's not going to change anything for your account.

**Danny Armand:** But if I click it, like, what happens?
**Danny Armand:** They just don't get charged.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, well, it's just not going to get charged through the account.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So there's going to be nothing that shows for the actual client facing side.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just fy.

**Danny Armand:** Yeah.
**Danny Armand:** So you can additional mail here.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So additional mail.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's say you wanted to bill for mail as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can go ahead and click additional mail and then that's going to show up basically making them add a payment section there into the additional mail section.

**Danny Armand:** On the app in this tab if they were to go here.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Correct.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.

**Danny Armand:** Got it.
**Danny Armand:** So if they were to do like create campaign, it will charge them through here.
**Danny Armand:** Correct.
**Danny Armand:** Got it.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Which I would still recommend, Danny.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I would still recommend doing that through our payment process.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I wish Nate was on this call because he's usually responsible for them.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I know he's away, so I'm just stepping in to help out with it if you want to jump back into the back end.

**Danny Armand:** All right, perfect.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So websites, visitor resolutions and audience builder, three of the most important things.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is totally up to what you're going to end up charging your client.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you tell them, hey, you're only going to have one website pixel, you're going to have two, you're going to have three, whatever it might be.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can select that here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's automatically going to allow the person to then create multiple websites up to a certain cap.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Same with visitor resolutions.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we pretty much just max it out.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I always add six zeros.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is going to change to unlimited, but I always.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Six zeros is.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Or a few zeros There is the perfect sweet spot to do.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then same with audience builder.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is Going to be the amount of intent list that can actually be pulled.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I, I, I say the same thing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I, you know, five, six zeros there if you want it to be unlimited for somebody.

**Danny Armand:** And then where do I set the pricing for this?

**Alex Ciereszko:** You're, you're saying the, are you charging per record?

**Danny Armand:** Well, let's say I want to test it out where this week I want to charge per record.
**Danny Armand:** One client, I want to charge per audience, another client, I want to charge flat rate.
**Danny Armand:** How do I just do that?
**Danny Armand:** I want to streamline the process.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So what you could do is the markup price per lead.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me, let me shoot Lindsay a message real quick.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Bear with me here one second.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Here we go.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I wish she could jump in because she knows all the nuances.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Danny, I just don't want to tell you something incorrectly.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Yeah.
**Danny Armand:** See if they can jump in.
**Danny Armand:** In the meantime, maybe there's some questions you can answer.
**Danny Armand:** So number one, so as an example, I want to pull all the clients that are currently in this because initially I just did the regular platform with you.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** You don't want it to say Retarget IQ to have my logo.
**Danny Armand:** So either a, can we add my logo in here or 100.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Danny, could you do me a favor right now and just email it to me?
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can use my Alex at Retarget email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Going to give that to, to Sammy right away to change that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And also the login portal.

**Danny Armand:** So there's no via.
**Danny Armand:** Send it via.
**Danny Armand:** How would you say this?
**Danny Armand:** Slack.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Or you could do slack or email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I would say email would be a little bit easier for me right now just being on my computer, but whatever's easiest for you, I'll get to it.

**Danny Armand:** All right, Let me email this.
**Danny Armand:** What's your email, Alex?

**Alex Ciereszko:** A l e x retargetiq.com.

**Danny Armand:** Got it.
**Danny Armand:** I'm just going to say this.
**Danny Armand:** Harmony logos.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, sweet.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So Lindsay's going to join up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I just don't want to tell you the wrong things, Danny.

**Danny Armand:** All right.
**Danny Armand:** I just put a little note here just so we can refer to it if need be.
**Danny Armand:** Sweet.
**Danny Armand:** But let me attach these logos.
**Danny Armand:** One second here.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Perfect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then as, as she jumps in, I will get those over to Sammy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So then that way he has them and he can clean up the.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That should have been done initially, Danny.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** All right, we're going to do this one.
**Danny Armand:** And let me see.
**Danny Armand:** Can I toggle between the logos should.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I need to, in terms of changing that, that top left logo?

**Danny Armand:** Yeah.
**Danny Armand:** Well, just because I have a white and A black.
**Danny Armand:** And so if I.
**Danny Armand:** If they go white, you know, I don't want them to see a black logo, and if they go black, I want them to see the white.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** 100.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me ask Sammy how that would look.

**Danny Armand:** Lindsay, thank you for joining.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I. I jumped on with Danny because I wanted to help him out, and there's just some nuanced questions that I know you're the pro at with the answering and billing and stuff like that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't want to steer Danny in the wrong way at all.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Sure.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So we're creating a mail campaign, so.

**Danny Armand:** No, no.
**Danny Armand:** So let me go back into this original one.
**Danny Armand:** So just, I mean, some little things.
**Danny Armand:** So, you know, one of the questions was just additional mail, bill, manually, etc.
**Danny Armand:** Where do I set pricing for these types of things?

**Lindsey Rudy:** Like how select additional mail.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Okay.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then scroll down, go to markup price per lead, and then choose what you're charging them.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So we'll charge you 85 cents, and then you can put in what you would charge your customer.

**Danny Armand:** I don't know what they're charging the 85 cents.
**Danny Armand:** Like, where does it say that this is 65, obviously, but.

**Lindsey Rudy:** I think because that's like our hard cost for the 4 by 6.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So are they doing the 6 by 9 or the 4 by 6?

**Danny Armand:** No, to be honest with you, this is mostly just neither.
**Danny Armand:** Just wanting to know, like, like, for example, if I were to set this as 65 cents and you guys are charging me 85 cents, then technically I'm losing 20 cents every time I use this.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And if I.

**Danny Armand:** Then, you know, I'm just losing money for no reason.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So that's like the lowest.
**Lindsey Rudy:** That's the four by six price.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So it's like the lowest price.

**Danny Armand:** That in my private notes then is just you guys charge 85 cents and.

**Lindsey Rudy:** That'S for this by nine.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then you have to put what the markup, like what.
**Lindsey Rudy:** What is the total price that you're charging that person for the mail?

**Danny Armand:** Well, so that's the thing.
**Danny Armand:** I mean, it's.
**Danny Armand:** It's not necessarily that I'm even really speaking about mail particularly.
**Danny Armand:** I'm just saying where can I adjust, like, what the cost is versus what the price is?
**Danny Armand:** You know what I mean?
**Danny Armand:** You know, if you're using like, go high level, which maybe you guys know, I'm sure it says, hey, if you want to use our AI bot, it costs 97.
**Danny Armand:** You can charge $147, therefore your profit.
**Danny Armand:** Is that right?
**Danny Armand:** So I just want to know, like, I'm Just getting used to this platform, you know.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah.

**Danny Armand:** And you know, a lot of the things, like, again, I don't really know what's happening on this side and I just want to create hours.
**Danny Armand:** That's so it's streamlined and I know what we can and can't do.
**Danny Armand:** So as an example, if I wanted to charge them per website, where do I set this price?

**Lindsey Rudy:** You do your own billing.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So we're not necessarily running your billing through this.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You're simply up the allowance.
**Lindsey Rudy:** The allowance is here.

**Danny Armand:** Got it.
**Danny Armand:** So this is literally just.
**Danny Armand:** I set an account, it's free, so to speak.
**Danny Armand:** I am then just in our billing based on some API where this hooks up to our stripe, I'm assuming API key.
**Danny Armand:** Then we set up that billing based on this, Correct?

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So, for example, let's just use a hundred dollars.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So you're going to charge this client $100 to use it for one site.
**Lindsey Rudy:** They're going to get 15,000 resolutions, they're going to get 10 audience builder lists, and they're going to be paying $1 for each mail.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Piece up what the client gets.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then on your end, you would have to put them into a package or a tier, and that is completely on you.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You could charge them $10,000 or you could charge.

**Danny Armand:** As an example then.
**Danny Armand:** So where, like I get that now, how do I automate that?
**Danny Armand:** Because I do have developers on my staff and team who can create these API keys.
**Danny Armand:** But this seems to be grayed out here.
**Danny Armand:** Click on it.
**Danny Armand:** So I don't know what I do there.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Let.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So API knowledge is going to be pushed to Sammy.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So I'll just have him like hop in and maybe even record a video to let you know how to do that.
**Lindsey Rudy:** But yeah, essentially I can't really do.

**Danny Armand:** Anything with Consume Budget, API key or Affiliate link.
**Danny Armand:** They're just grayed out.
**Danny Armand:** Whereas I can enter a password here.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** That would be the password for the client if you were allowing them to like, to enter the dashboard.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** All right.
**Danny Armand:** So again, this is just a test account.
**Danny Armand:** So what do I do?
**Danny Armand:** I just create Subscription?

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You can click Create Subscription.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And again, it's not going to be billing like our platform is not going to be billing your clients.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You are going to be billing your.

**Danny Armand:** Clients through the API key that as of right this second, I can't necessarily access.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Let me actually slack Sami and ask him.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Lindsay, I'm going to have them do the logos too.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Danny sent over his new logos to put on there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'm going to let them know about that.

**Danny Armand:** Yeah.
**Danny Armand:** So I have.
**Danny Armand:** As of right this moment, there was a couple things.
**Danny Armand:** So I have this with you guys.
**Danny Armand:** Right.
**Danny Armand:** I'm just going to go overview here.
**Danny Armand:** I have a few clients on this already and so rather than redoing all this and having to reinstall all these pixels and reinstall everything, either a, can we migrate just my logos over here and then B, in the.
**Danny Armand:** How would you say.
**Danny Armand:** Well, there's two kind of sections.
**Danny Armand:** Number one, three, I guess.
**Danny Armand:** One, replace the logo at the top here.
**Danny Armand:** Two, if possible, replace the pixel ID so that it reflects Harmony, not retarget IQ.
**Danny Armand:** And then three would be replace the actual URL.
**Danny Armand:** So app, instead of going to app.retargetiq.com they should go to app.harmony.com dashboard.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yes, we'll send you DNS instructions to do that.
**Lindsey Rudy:** If you are.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So if you are fully white labeling the pixel as well, they.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I believe they need to be reinstalled.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So, like already I alone.

**Danny Armand:** But new people.
**Danny Armand:** New people.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Whatever is in your core dashboard would have to be like reset up essentially in your dashboard because it's a completely separate instance.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I know that's like a bit of an extra step.
**Lindsey Rudy:** But if you want the pixel to be white labeled, it has to be reinstalled.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Sammy can do like some sort of like daisy chain to prevent that.

**Danny Armand:** Here's what I would just say, then I'm 100% okay with the pixel that has been installed.
**Danny Armand:** Currently, all of these clients are fine.
**Danny Armand:** But if we can instead make that the URL is app.harmony.com or whatever the hell, whatever it is.
**Danny Armand:** And then instead of this logo here for RetargetIQ, it should just have my logo and then we can keep it as is new ones.
**Danny Armand:** We'll do whatever new ones we'll do.

**Lindsey Rudy:** In the new dashboard.

**Danny Armand:** Yeah, that's correct.

**Lindsey Rudy:** We can do the logo now if you have it ready.

**Danny Armand:** Yeah, I sent it over.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Lindsay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It was sent to me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm gonna go in my email right now.

**Danny Armand:** I can also, if you're on Slack, I can drop it to you right now as well.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I got them.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Lindsay, I'm gonna forward these to you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Is that okay?

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah, I'll just do it on the.
**Lindsey Rudy:** On the back end.
**Lindsey Rudy:** No big deal.

**Danny Armand:** Oh, cool.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then I'll get with Sammy on the API key to interior stripe.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Okay.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I know other people are doing that, so again, I, I don't know offhand how to install that or ungrate it out, to be honest, but you have to look for some sort of password for Them.

**Danny Armand:** Yeah, I just want to.
**Danny Armand:** Sure.
**Danny Armand:** So real quick, password.
**Danny Armand:** So Team Rubber is okay.
**Danny Armand:** So if I create this user right now, it basically will just add this person with a dashboard that will then reflect with our logos, etc.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So then if you go to.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Did you already set up the logo?
**Lindsey Rudy:** Go to users.

**Danny Armand:** Yep.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then your users are here.

**Danny Armand:** Yep.

**Lindsey Rudy:** If you go to like those three dots, that's how you impersonate the account.

**Danny Armand:** Impersonate.
**Danny Armand:** So impersonate.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then you get your.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So this person needs to be onboarded.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So you can either send that to.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You can send them your login.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Once the DNS is updated, they can fill out these details.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Or if you're not allowing access to your clients, I would say we're like 5050 where people just want the white label to access their clients and report back to them.
**Lindsey Rudy:** But you can also just send them this.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Send them a link to login, sign up and enter their.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I think it skips past the payment details because you guys are charging on your own.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Or you enter the API key and it will actually take their payment details.

**Danny Armand:** I just want to make sure like my team knows what is happening here.
**Danny Armand:** One second.
**Danny Armand:** I guess I need to do it.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Probably because your admin already using that.

**Danny Armand:** Hold on a second here.
**Danny Armand:** This is not real, but I'm just creating a fake one.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Something went wrong.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Just the.com and remove the slash.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Or just remove the slash.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Actually you should be good there.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so real quick, like.
**Danny Armand:** All right.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** So okay, this is the flow for your customer.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** So a client.
**Danny Armand:** If I had just set this up for a client just now.
**Danny Armand:** They will be here specifically.
**Danny Armand:** Got it.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** So now they see all these things.
**Danny Armand:** Roger that.
**Danny Armand:** Now how do I make it so it does not say harmony.dashboard.datashopper.com we'll send.

**Lindsey Rudy:** You the DNS record instructions and then you'll just fix or you'll add the DNS record and it will remove the data shopper and it will just say Harmony.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Okay.

**Danny Armand:** Now if I'm setting these up without client access, do I need to enter payment details?

**Lindsey Rudy:** What you would do on the back end.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So hit stop impersonating in the right hand corner, you'll click on the little face icon.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Sorry, we're going back and forth.

**Danny Armand:** No, no, this is.
**Danny Armand:** That's kind of what I want.
**Danny Armand:** I want to just make sure I'm.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Like go to users.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** So if you want the client to skip past putting in their payment details, click edit the next.
**Lindsey Rudy:** The little pen.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Click bill manually.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then they won't like that that payment details step will show up, but it will simply just present the pixel after they get past entering in their website and their address.
**Lindsey Rudy:** It will just show the pixel instead of having speaking.

**Danny Armand:** I could for example, just.
**Danny Armand:** Let's say I sign up a client today and they pay $2,000.
**Danny Armand:** I could just bill them through my current billing bill manually and then set up their thing that way.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Exactly.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Just remove the dashes from the website to save this.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** All right.
**Danny Armand:** Let me just get out of here.
**Danny Armand:** Let me just do.

**Lindsey Rudy:** No dashes.

**Danny Armand:** Roger that.
**Danny Armand:** Update user.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Impersonate.

**Danny Armand:** So here's generate API key.
**Danny Armand:** It looks like here.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yes.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I think because there was no.

**Danny Armand:** Now there's an API key.
**Danny Armand:** And so now maybe I can pull this into our building.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** So then let's go to impersonate.
**Danny Armand:** So now I am quote unquote, this client as if I was logging in.
**Danny Armand:** How do I see the original like dash, not Dashboard.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Sorry.

**Danny Armand:** The log screen.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Go to.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Just go through this onboarding really quickly and we'll skip.
**Lindsey Rudy:** It will skip over the payment details because we checked build manually enter that enter address.
**Lindsey Rudy:** It can be anything.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then you see how it skipped over that payment.

**Danny Armand:** Yes.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And that will be replaced with the DNS record.

**Danny Armand:** Got it.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Then go to Dashboard.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then this is what the.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You know, the dashboard you're used to seeing.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** How do I customize this dashboard if possible?

**Lindsey Rudy:** We don't have that capability now.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Looking to customize.

**Danny Armand:** Got it.
**Danny Armand:** Well, just color, you know, overall, maybe I want this to be a more purple because our colors are purple, et cetera.

**Lindsey Rudy:** I'm sure we will add that feature in the near future.

**Danny Armand:** Roger that.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Next thing for me was also just.
**Danny Armand:** All right, so this is just kind of a question on the platform itself, what is identified but filtered?

**Lindsey Rudy:** That means that we've identified that many users, but with the filter that is set website level or demographic level, we're not presenting all of those.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Those users, essentially.

**Danny Armand:** So for example, this is probably filtering people in California, which means that if people outside of California are being identified, just not.
**Danny Armand:** Got it.
**Danny Armand:** Okay, thank you.
**Danny Armand:** That is a huge help.
**Danny Armand:** Then next thing was just the integrations, right on this side.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah.

**Danny Armand:** If I go for example, into Just because it doesn't.
**Danny Armand:** It didn't work as like per.
**Danny Armand:** Like a normal.
**Danny Armand:** Let's call it zapier integration.
**Danny Armand:** So if I go to edit settings.
**Danny Armand:** So does everything have to be configured via webhook specifically or what is this?

**Lindsey Rudy:** So you would authorize your book.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Are you ready to you would authorize you'd walk through this and that's when the webhook actually comes into play like the webhook is after.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So once you.
**Lindsey Rudy:** The webhook, you copy it and then go into the drop down under settings on the left hand side.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, one second here, let me just connect to this page.
**Danny Armand:** I'm in.
**Danny Armand:** Great.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Flow configuration and I believe Facebook.
**Lindsey Rudy:** All you need is do you have all of this set up like your audience for all of this already?

**Danny Armand:** So actually, I mean, that's something I kind of wanted to ask you guys again.
**Danny Armand:** This is my first time really using the platform.
**Danny Armand:** Right.
**Danny Armand:** So what I'm doing right now is essentially for this client, Washington Dental, I would.
**Danny Armand:** I'm creating an audience or this needs to be linked to an audience.

**Lindsey Rudy:** You have to set up an audience in meta.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** So I'll call the audience like harmony audience or something like that or like, I don't know, 100k plus users, whatever.
**Danny Armand:** Call it something.
**Danny Armand:** Build that audience in meta, then link to this audience.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So you'll link this in.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And meta only needs email for the match rate.
**Lindsey Rudy:** We're between like 70 to 90 match rate with people's emails that come through on the visitor identification.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then you should be tapping there.

**Danny Armand:** For all of this.

**Lindsey Rudy:** I would not put.
**Lindsey Rudy:** No, you don't need to put any of that.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So the audience name would be the name that's in your ad account.

**Danny Armand:** So I guess how does that work?
**Danny Armand:** Only because if I choose email here, like maybe I'm confused because if I.

**Lindsey Rudy:** You would get like a log that failed.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So the audience name has to be the name that's in your ad account.

**Danny Armand:** But what if I name it something like audience one?
**Danny Armand:** Like there's no audience one here.
**Danny Armand:** It just has these.

**Lindsey Rudy:** You're just typing it.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You're just typing it in, essentially.

**Danny Armand:** Oh, so literally I go here and I go audience one.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yes.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then your ad account id, you type in and then audience id.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So Ad account.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Exactly.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then audience id, you would type that in.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Got it.

**Danny Armand:** I don't.
**Danny Armand:** These specific things.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep, there you go.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So like you would grab that ID there.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Actually that's your.
**Lindsey Rudy:** That would be like your manager if we're going backwards.

**Danny Armand:** So I would just enter the audience ID in here and then email.
**Danny Armand:** Do I just click email?
**Danny Armand:** And then it's good.

**Lindsey Rudy:** That's where you would click email and activate.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so this isn't going to work.
**Danny Armand:** But like, you know, I just.

**Lindsey Rudy:** How you set it up.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.

**Danny Armand:** So now this is connected all Right.
**Danny Armand:** So then I guess real quick, like walk me through.
**Danny Armand:** Obviously, I don't even know if this is going to work because it's just.

**Lindsey Rudy:** You know, it will, it will show you like, it will give you the webhook.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So go back to connect.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So now that webhook is ready, go to Settings, Settings, Integrations.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Add integration.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Type Facebook or meta.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I think it's just under Facebook.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then select the website.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So if they have multiple websites, they'll show.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So connect.

**Danny Armand:** Washington, Dental.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then you drop the webhook URL there.

**Danny Armand:** Got it.
**Danny Armand:** This is obviously not it, but you know, I'm just going through questions.

**Lindsey Rudy:** If you are going to do this, I would uninstall that.

**Danny Armand:** Yeah, I'm going to do exactly that.
**Danny Armand:** All right, so then basically I just hit submit and then they're linked on both sides.
**Danny Armand:** So if you want that, just so.

**Lindsey Rudy:** I'm clear on the Facebook meta side and on your dashboard.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so then let's pretend I hit submit and that went through and everything's good.
**Danny Armand:** Then basically what I've done is I've gone and connected.
**Danny Armand:** Like what?
**Danny Armand:** I guess what I'm also asking is what data is being sent?

**Lindsey Rudy:** The email.

**Danny Armand:** The email of what?
**Danny Armand:** Like these.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Your visitor identity identifications.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.

**Danny Armand:** And then what about if I were to create an audience as an example?
**Danny Armand:** How do I get the audience into meta?

**Lindsey Rudy:** Sure.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So let's just make.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Just make an audience and run it like with anything, like topic.

**Danny Armand:** Just to implant.

**Lindsey Rudy:** I don't know if I.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Do I have implant?
**Lindsey Rudy:** Oh, I do.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Okay, cool.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Go ahead and just run it.
**Lindsey Rudy:** It doesn't matter.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Build audience also.
**Danny Armand:** Same thing.
**Danny Armand:** I don't know if you guys can like unlimit this account specifically or just give me control of it so that it doesn't have four out of ten audiences.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yes.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Okay, so go to audiences.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Drop down and go to all.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Left hand side all.
**Lindsey Rudy:** There's our records.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Go to preview.

**Danny Armand:** Yep.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Go to download all.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Download all.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Hit like name it dental implants and then give it a description.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I usually just copy and paste it, like test or whatever.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Save.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then go to audiences again on the left.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Oh, we're already here.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Nevermind.
**Lindsey Rudy:** They like fix that.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So it goes right here.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You can download it once it's done processing.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Or if you go to the right and click actions, you can push it to the ad account right away.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Just hit by hitting send.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Or you can pull it to an ad account.

**Danny Armand:** And then this is the same URL webhook that I've gotten in integrations side.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You have.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So we have.
**Lindsey Rudy:** We have an add webhook that you have to do, and we have a pixel web hook that you have to do.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Similar setup.
**Lindsey Rudy:** But they just have to.
**Lindsey Rudy:** There's two of them.
**Lindsey Rudy:** One is just the user identified, and one is going to be from your ads.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And you simply drop that in and hit send.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And again, you can send it once or you can schedule to send it.

**Danny Armand:** All right, and what's the difference?

**Lindsey Rudy:** So when you schedule the audience.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Hold on.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You have to schedule the audience first.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Well, for it to make sense.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So let's say we love this audience.
**Lindsey Rudy:** We want it to run constantly.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Go to the right where it says actions.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I would schedule this to run every week, every day.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Whatever you want to do.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Let's just go ahead and save it.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Say we're going to run it.

**Danny Armand:** Sure.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then once that is scheduled, it will run on the scheduled date.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then you'll go to actions, input schedule to ad account.

**Danny Armand:** Got it.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And the same time.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So when you get a new audience, let's say you get a new audience every Friday.
**Lindsey Rudy:** This will push every Friday.
**Lindsey Rudy:** If you schedule it every day, I would schedule this to push your ad account every day.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so if I push this to the ad account every day, then in the ad account.
**Danny Armand:** One thing I guess I'm not clear on is.
**Danny Armand:** So this is the webhook.
**Danny Armand:** What will be the name of this audience?
**Danny Armand:** Does it automatically via webhook.
**Danny Armand:** Update this to dental implants audience test.

**Lindsey Rudy:** You have to build the audience in the platform.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so I build the.
**Danny Armand:** So, all right, so basically the flow would be I go to client ad account, call it dental imp, build audience of dental implant one, repeat every day.
**Danny Armand:** Then I go into your platform, I create this audience via the filters.
**Danny Armand:** And anything that I want to use after the audience is created, then I go to this audience specifically.
**Danny Armand:** I. Oh, no.
**Danny Armand:** But because first I have to integrate.
**Danny Armand:** Do I have to first?
**Danny Armand:** It sounds like there's a first step before that.
**Danny Armand:** Right.

**Lindsey Rudy:** So step one, make the audience in the platform.

**Danny Armand:** Got it.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Step two, set up the integration.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Because that integration needs to go to that audience.
**Lindsey Rudy:** It has to already be there in order for us to send it somewhere.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so what if I want to send five different audiences from five different sources, like dental implants, dental cleanings, some other thing.
**Danny Armand:** Children's dentistry, who knows, Right?
**Danny Armand:** So how do I integrate those five audiences in five separate audiences?

**Lindsey Rudy:** I think you just do the audience id.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Like you would set up the audience id.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so then if I were to go back to workflows here and I am in there.
**Danny Armand:** I hit edit settings, flow configuration, and.

**Lindsey Rudy:** You would set which audience id, but.

**Danny Armand:** It looks like I can only do one at a time.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yes.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So you would have to set up.

**Danny Armand:** Because as of this point, let's pretend I have audience 1 dental implants.
**Danny Armand:** I have to create.
**Danny Armand:** Let's say then I would have to manually go from my ad account, create five different audiences, and then only in those five different audiences, I would have to come into here and.
**Danny Armand:** But I can only do one.
**Danny Armand:** I can only link to one account, one ID, one everything.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Right.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I think right now it's just one.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I don't know if that's going to change NB2, but I believe it's just pushing to one audience.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yes, you have.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So if we go to this, like, Washington Dental, like you did, like, iterations of that URL, you could have multiple.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So if it's like Washington Dental, slash children's, I believe that's how I would do it.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Correct.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I agree.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Lindsay and I did speak to Thomas.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I do believe that that was part of the push for V2.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just so we're clear, Danny, don't quote me on that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm going to get an answer, man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We've just been scattered with the V2 launch, so.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we're working on that.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I believe we're either gonna have like one connection with multiple audiences or you have to just set up, like a different website within.

**Danny Armand:** Yeah.
**Danny Armand:** If we could, I mean, figure something like that, because it's a. I mean, long story short, that means I can only test out any given time, one thing at a time, which is extraordinarily slow for us, especially the clientele.
**Danny Armand:** So that would be a huge help if there's some resolution or solution.
**Danny Armand:** I'm.
**Danny Armand:** I'll even try and think of some things on my end.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah, feel free.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I mean, we're.
**Lindsey Rudy:** We're always open to client feedback, building stuff, using the API in unique ways.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I mean, it's definitely a need to have more than one audience.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.

**Danny Armand:** Just.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** All right, all right.
**Danny Armand:** So we'll have to figure that one out.
**Danny Armand:** But as of right now, it looks like I can do one.
**Danny Armand:** So I guess, you know, same thing, kind of back to the.
**Danny Armand:** Back to basics was just if we could, if possible, the things that are important for me, as at least as of right now, are this specific setup.
**Danny Armand:** Number one would be to obviously just unlimit this one to.
**Danny Armand:** You know, so it's not three out of ten audiences here left.
**Danny Armand:** This was an account that was set up before I did the white label.
**Danny Armand:** So, etc.
**Danny Armand:** If we could change the logo specifically on this one and then the URLs would be great.
**Danny Armand:** And then.

**Lindsey Rudy:** So the URL we can only do in the white label, not in the retarget platform.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so then let me just think then.
**Danny Armand:** So in this case these are like your old.

**Lindsey Rudy:** These are like you're not old but like your previous clients that have been in retarget, right?

**Danny Armand:** Yeah, well, yeah, I just, I just put them all in.
**Danny Armand:** Long story short, like I don't want to log in when I'm doing a screen share and it says retarget iq.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah, we can change that.
**Lindsey Rudy:** But with your white label that will be fully white labeled.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So anyone new you're onboarding will be.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I'm sorry, I'm forgetting the name of your harmony.

**Danny Armand:** What I can maybe do for this, I would just have.
**Danny Armand:** Can I, can I.
**Danny Armand:** For example, let's say this is Washington Dental, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
**Danny Armand:** Can I just create five accounts for Washington Dental, have five separate integrations going into the audience or is it limited?
**Danny Armand:** You know I'm talking, you know, I'm talking about like for example, rather than being here and going into integrations and individually connecting this one with five separate audiences, could I go to Washington Dental Account 1, Washington Dental Account 2, Account 3, Account 4, 5.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah, okay.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah, that's how I would do that.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Because integration, when you click on like the settings, like integrations is going to be on website level.

**Danny Armand:** Roger that.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Like if you toggle off of Washington Dental, I believe the installed on meta will go away.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Like if you go to where Washington Dental is, where your websites are.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Oh, did he already do that?

**Danny Armand:** Let me see, what does this do?

**Lindsey Rudy:** Okay, cool.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Then he already did it.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Okay, great.

**Danny Armand:** So what this would be go to integrations.
**Danny Armand:** It just has two now or what's the.

**Lindsey Rudy:** So it would be per website.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So I think that they're already working through this.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So if you go to Settings.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yes, he already worked that.
**Lindsey Rudy:** He's already done.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Oh my gosh, like hoping it was going to be ready for the end of next month.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So it looks like that's already done.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so this is how I would go in and do this.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Perfect.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I'm glad it's already worked out.

**Danny Armand:** That works great.
**Danny Armand:** Awesome.
**Danny Armand:** I love it.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then as I was saying, if you go to settings and use that dropdown on the left and when you click Integrations you're going to select which website that goes to.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So if it goes to Washington Dental or if it goes to any of the other dental offices, you would connect it that way.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, awesome.
**Danny Armand:** The only thing I think that would be helpful as well on your guys end is maybe some naming conventions because this just says meta connector.
**Danny Armand:** If I click on leads to the same page installed workflows.
**Danny Armand:** As a, just as an example, if I have audience one, audience two, audience three, it just says Meta Connector.
**Danny Armand:** Meta Connector.
**Danny Armand:** Meta connector, then I have, let's say I have 15 audiences that I'm trying to test out.
**Danny Armand:** It will just say meta connector for each one.
**Danny Armand:** So maybe if it's possible to have.
**Danny Armand:** Oh wait.
**Danny Armand:** Fantastic.
**Danny Armand:** Live, we're all good.
**Danny Armand:** Great.

**Lindsey Rudy:** I love when this happens.

**Danny Armand:** Great.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Because I haven't even seen that yet as we move.

**Danny Armand:** All right, cool.
**Danny Armand:** So then, yeah, so then same thing for me.
**Danny Armand:** That looks good.
**Danny Armand:** If we could just replace this retarget IQ with my logo which I believe was sent to you users.
**Danny Armand:** I'm just going to walk through just so I have a basic understanding.
**Danny Armand:** So if I want to create someone new, I stop impersonating, go to users.
**Danny Armand:** I create a user, I follow the steps, the spiel.
**Danny Armand:** I give it a name, I give it a this, I give it to that.
**Danny Armand:** Question, can I use the same email more than once?

**Lindsey Rudy:** No, has to be a different email.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Actually, so then wait, so if I.
**Danny Armand:** That's actually fine.
**Danny Armand:** So if I use my Harmony email though and I give myself unlimited stuff and then I just bill my clients through our payment processor, I can just use that, et cetera.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Okay, yeah, you can.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then just choose the role.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Have you gone through like the user relationships too?
**Lindsey Rudy:** So if you have your sales team, you can actually give them access to certain accounts without giving them access to every account?

**Danny Armand:** No, we haven't gone through that actually.
**Danny Armand:** I mean so real quick, what are these things here on the left hand bar?
**Danny Armand:** Filter categories.
**Danny Armand:** Like what am I doing?

**Lindsey Rudy:** I believe this is something new.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I have not seen that yet.
**Lindsey Rudy:** It looks like he's pushing a few things live on this call.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So I will ask him.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I believe that might just be like.

**Danny Armand:** This stuff does like create footer link.
**Danny Armand:** It's like just gives you a name and a URL.
**Danny Armand:** I don't really understand what that's for.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And the footer would be in the bottom of your dashboard.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So.

**Danny Armand:** What am I like if I would just put a random URL in there.
**Danny Armand:** For example, like let's say I put the URL for instantly like and that's in there.
**Danny Armand:** Like what is that doing?

**Lindsey Rudy:** I guess that's gonna show up on the bottom of your dashboard.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So you could put like your support center.

**Danny Armand:** So if I wanted to as an example on the dashboard, send people to, let's say our front landing page for something, I can send them there.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Put like book a call or schedule.

**Danny Armand:** Got it.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** All right.
**Danny Armand:** And then subscription accounts is just whatever these are.
**Danny Armand:** These are what is daily rate.

**Lindsey Rudy:** So I know that's what you're charging them per lead or per like mail piece essentially.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, what happens if they like how do I set it?
**Danny Armand:** Where for as an example, let's say they.
**Danny Armand:** I'm just to going, going to click one of these.
**Danny Armand:** So this has resolutions is fine.
**Danny Armand:** Let's say they're like, oh, Danny, can I get another audience?
**Danny Armand:** Same thing here.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Edit on the right hand side, top, top right.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You can put as many audience builder lists as they need.

**Danny Armand:** And then how do I do it so that as an example this could happen automatically.
**Danny Armand:** Like for example, client A is doesn't need to contact me, but instead goes over their limit for audiences.
**Danny Armand:** So they have access to 10 and they want 11.
**Danny Armand:** So they are able to get 11 and it just builds them automatically.
**Danny Armand:** Is that something that's doable?

**Lindsey Rudy:** It's not built in yet, but it could be.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I mean maybe like a pop up where it's like top up for five more audiences.
**Lindsey Rudy:** We, we want to do that to Zapier.

**Danny Armand:** Right.
**Danny Armand:** So it's with Zapier you get like 2000, you know, 2000 hooks or something like that in your base plan.
**Danny Armand:** And then every time you go above your hook, it just charges you a premium 35 cents, let's say, per hook.

**Lindsey Rudy:** We don't have that.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** They would have to contact and you would have to open up their audience builder list.

**Danny Armand:** Got it.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** And then basically it will just like, it will just stop working essentially if they try to do more than 10 audiences and it just won't let them number one.
**Danny Armand:** It'll say like you've reached your max or something.
**Danny Armand:** And then resolutions.
**Danny Armand:** Okay, all right, that's great.
**Danny Armand:** And then audits.
**Danny Armand:** What is what?
**Danny Armand:** I mean, just so I know it's just like audit logs or something like that.

**Lindsey Rudy:** They're logins.

**Danny Armand:** Roger that.
**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Subscription grants.
**Danny Armand:** Transactions.
**Danny Armand:** Transactions is what, like what should be showing up here.

**Lindsey Rudy:** If you have your API hooked in, you'd be able to see when they.

**Danny Armand:** Purchased and then what's user relationships.

**Lindsey Rudy:** So that's where you can add your sales team.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So click Create user and then click one of your like demo accounts and you like type in which one you.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I think under Danny.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Danny test.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Perfect.
**Lindsey Rudy:** And then agent, would you just.

**Danny Armand:** So I know.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Pardon?

**Danny Armand:** It says with trashed.

**Lindsey Rudy:** So like, if someone deletes their account or they're no longer active, you would be able to still see that account.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then you would select a admin.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Do you have an admin already?
**Lindsey Rudy:** I think it's under test.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Commission.
**Danny Armand:** What is exactly?
**Danny Armand:** I mean, I'm guessing.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You could set a commission rate for them, and that way you're just able to track it again.
**Lindsey Rudy:** We're not billing for you.
**Lindsey Rudy:** You would just be able to see like.

**Danny Armand:** Oh, so just setting what I promised that person in commission.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Right, right.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Exactly.

**Danny Armand:** All right.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then create user relationship.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So then when Danny test your friend logs in, he would have access to only that one account, not all 10, all 20, all 50 of your accounts eventually.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so the user is the person, the agent is what?
**Danny Armand:** Like, what's the difference between you?

**Lindsey Rudy:** The agent is the salesperson, so.

**Danny Armand:** And the user is who they have access to.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And the user is who they have access to.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** So I could have assigned multiple to this one if I wanted to.
**Danny Armand:** Actually look like I can, but.
**Danny Armand:** Oh, if there was more in here.

**Lindsey Rudy:** I don't know if there was more, but you have to set up with each.

**Danny Armand:** I see.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Person.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So you would assign.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So let's just do this.
**Lindsey Rudy:** How?
**Lindsey Rudy:** I would set it up.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I would set it up.
**Lindsey Rudy:** The user would be Danny test.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.

**Lindsey Rudy:** And then the agent would be admin or whoever this 10 is, I think.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yep.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So now the admin, if they log into their app with their admin credentials or whatever, it wouldn't be the admin, it would be Joe or whatever.
**Lindsey Rudy:** He would have access to Danny test only.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So if he logged into the back end of the dashboard, he would only see Danny test.

**Danny Armand:** Roger that.
**Danny Armand:** Okay, cool.
**Danny Armand:** Same thing.
**Danny Armand:** Sidebar links.
**Danny Armand:** What's this?
**Danny Armand:** Just so I kind of.
**Danny Armand:** And again, by the way, I want to know just so that if people ask me, because they will ask, you know, then I'm.
**Danny Armand:** You know, I can tell them what's going on.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Danny, I believe you won't.

**Danny Armand:** Oh, go ahead, Lindsay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Hey, Lindsay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Did we lose you?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Danny?

**Danny Armand:** Yeah, I don't know if I'm hearing anything.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, Lindsay, you're not muted, but like you just went totally mute there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It just cut out randomly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** She's going to rejoin Danny.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, but I was going to say, Danny, you're.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You're going to be the.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The back end of this won't be client facing, correct?

**Danny Armand:** Yeah.
**Danny Armand:** No, no, no, no.
**Danny Armand:** Never.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.

**Danny Armand:** So we'll certainly because I don't know how to operate these things and if I don't know then then I can't definitely team you know what I mean?
**Danny Armand:** Just be a big daisy chain of confusion.
**Danny Armand:** So I don't want that to happen.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I got you.

**Danny Armand:** I don't think we can still hear you.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Reason you can hear me now it like keeps asking me if I want my phone's mic.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I. I don't know why.

**Danny Armand:** No worries at all.
**Danny Armand:** Okay so I think it was just sidebar links is where I left off is just what like same thing is like where does this show?

**Lindsey Rudy:** Is this underneath that would show on their login screen.
**Lindsey Rudy:** So it's not going to be in the dashboard just on the login screen.

**Danny Armand:** Okay and then how do I customize the login screen so as an example same exact thing.
**Danny Armand:** It does not say.
**Danny Armand:** Let me just go to here one second.
**Danny Armand:** Let me go log out.
**Danny Armand:** I want it to be my image and our.
**Danny Armand:** You know this.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Is this your.
**Lindsey Rudy:** I can't see the URL.

**Danny Armand:** Is this your whitelist retargetiq.com forward/login because long story short, when I had signed up with you guys I initially signed up on the just the base platform upgraded to the white label.
**Danny Armand:** In this case same thing.

**Lindsey Rudy:** I would have to ask about that because I don't think that we can change retargeting login screen.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Like we can't change like we can.
**Lindsey Rudy:** We can change your white labels.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Yeah like harmony.

**Danny Armand:** Well first and foremost can we do you know do that and then work on maybe this thing separately and then definitely if possible to at least if I'm logging in through Retarget IQ then it shouldn't be here.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Yes.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Like client calls we could see if we can update the logo so when you're on a client call.
**Lindsey Rudy:** But as far as like changing retarget's main page specific for you, I don't think that's possible just because it would be universal.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Okay so I would log start your sales call and then we.
**Lindsey Rudy:** We should be able to change the logo just inside your specific dashboard.

**Danny Armand:** Yes, great.
**Danny Armand:** That would be super helpful because other than that I have to redo everything which would be a huge pain in the ass.
**Danny Armand:** What's the difference between connector high level connector v2 and high level connector v2.

**Lindsey Rudy:** Is going to be the one you're going to use.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Connector is going to be going away.
**Lindsey Rudy:** We just have it on there for legacy accounts.
**Lindsey Rudy:** We just have to leave it otherwise it will delete for everyone.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Okay, sounds good.
**Danny Armand:** And then Let me see here.
**Danny Armand:** I had maybe one or so more questions.

**Lindsey Rudy:** 3:30 guys that I'm late to.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Alex, do you think you can take from here?

**Alex Ciereszko:** All good, Lindsay?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, yeah, you got the text.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Thank you so much.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because I just wanted to make sure we're clear on the billing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But thank you so much, Lindsay.

**Danny Armand:** Yeah.

**Lindsey Rudy:** I'm sure we'll talk again.
**Lindsey Rudy:** Have a good one.

**Danny Armand:** So then, yeah, I mean, that's all good.
**Danny Armand:** You know, I definitely got it.
**Danny Armand:** So.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I just.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I just wanted to get her involved because I know she's really close to Sami, knows exactly what's going on in the development process.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I. I appreciate that.

**Danny Armand:** Yeah, no worries.
**Danny Armand:** Okay, so then the next thing for me is really just like these queries.
**Danny Armand:** What is this?
**Danny Armand:** SQL query?
**Danny Armand:** Sorry, I actually forget kind of.

**Alex Ciereszko:** What.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, so this is basically just exactly how the data is being extracted, right?
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you ever have an issue and let's say like, you know, you pull an audience and we say, hey, can you send us the query for this?
**Alex Ciereszko:** You're basically just going to copy and paste that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's the code that it's generating to pull data out of our identity graph.

**Danny Armand:** So why would you ask me that?
**Danny Armand:** Just so I'm clear.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's say you're pulling this list.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let's say once a week, all of a sudden you're like, Alex, this 22,000, you know, person list just turned into zero.
**Alex Ciereszko:** No idea what we did.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're going to go in and check this query and make sure that there's no component where maybe you messed up a date, maybe you messed up verbiage for something or the way you inputted data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's why we ask.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then we have it on each one for that exact reason.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we know exactly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Hey, this is the prompt that was put in to be able to extract that data.

**Danny Armand:** Okay, so then, next thing for me is.
**Danny Armand:** Let me see this.
**Danny Armand:** Advanced.
**Danny Armand:** What's advanced search?
**Danny Armand:** Difference between B2B or B2C?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Advanced search is going to be your static list.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So this is going to be homeowners specific, job titles, companies, things like that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's not showing intent data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Your intent B2C and intent B2B is going to be actual signals.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So live intent data.

**Danny Armand:** Roger that.
**Danny Armand:** Sounds good.
**Danny Armand:** Next thing, how do I do potentially multiple topics, slash.
**Danny Armand:** Is there a way to commingle topics?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, unfortunately right now, Danny, we have it one by one.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's going to make the data more accurate because we've noticed when we're doing multiple queries we are working on launching multiple queries as well as unlimited terms, which means you can go in and pick pretty much any term in the world and you're going to be able to pull those as well as things like, you know, roofers near me, best roofers near me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And you can like, you know, centralize that in a zip code or best dentist office near me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we are releasing that for right now.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's just.

**Danny Armand:** How would you call this intersecting these audiences?
**Danny Armand:** So topic one is, I'm just going to say dental implants.
**Danny Armand:** And, and you can filter that not by merging multiple topics into one large audience, but finding people who are in multiple intent based audiences.
**Danny Armand:** So dental implants maybe and all on four plants.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's exactly what we're going to try to do.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So then that way when you go in, you'll be able to select multiple topics and it'll be like, hey, this person has been matched on all three of these topics.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They're clearly super intentful going across all these terms and topics.
**Alex Ciereszko:** For right now, it's just one, but we're working on it.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** Honestly, I think that's it for me.
**Danny Armand:** The big things that I just need because I do have calls coming up with various clients and I just don't want every target iq.
**Danny Armand:** You can handle the logo specifically on this?
**Danny Armand:** Absolutely.
**Danny Armand:** Number two, open the audiences on this platform specifically, it's fine.
**Danny Armand:** If it's app.retargetiq.com that's fine.
**Danny Armand:** If they're not going to see my screen, then it's all good.
**Danny Armand:** I'll just do everything now through Harmony.
**Danny Armand:** But yeah, just if we can unlimit these audiences.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I got you.

**Danny Armand:** And, and then yeah, just make sure obviously that the same thing because I can't change it myself.
**Danny Armand:** So this would be, you know, unlimited, maybe a billion plus visitors and whatever else.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I can take care of both of those for you, Danny.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then I'll update you as soon as possible.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you have anything in the meantime, just ping us on Slack.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's the best way to get in touch with us.

**Danny Armand:** Yeah, I really appreciate it.
**Danny Armand:** Thank you.
**Danny Armand:** Because there was a lot of things I was just a little confused about.
**Danny Armand:** So.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I feel you, man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's like the hardest time too because we're like, we're teaching people about this platform and then there's so many features that are coming into V2 that are going to be released.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So like even your question, overlapping audiences or hey, having multiple audiences going in the same ad account, all that stuff's getting straightened out, so it's just been a.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's been a monster of a month, to be honest.

**Danny Armand:** No worries.
**Danny Armand:** Great.
**Danny Armand:** Thank you so much.
**Danny Armand:** I appreciate it.
**Danny Armand:** And, yeah, if we could just get those things asap, that would be really, really, really helpful.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Absolutely.

**Danny Armand:** Honestly, almost the most important one for me is this retarget iq, if we can.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, of course.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll make sure Lindsay gets that over to Sammy, and I'm hoping that'll be done by the end of today.

**Danny Armand:** Okay.
**Danny Armand:** And then just the audiences, because we're going to pull multiple and I'll set these up, but thank you so much.
**Danny Armand:** I appreciate it.

**Alex Ciereszko:** All right, brother, if you need anything, shoot me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Ping me on slack.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay?

**Danny Armand:** All right.
**Danny Armand:** Thank you very much, Alex.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.
