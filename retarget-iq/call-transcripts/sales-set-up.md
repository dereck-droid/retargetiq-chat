**Alex Ciereszko:** Sweet.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So email setup.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm going to jump in high level.

**Luke Mincey:** Cool.
**Luke Mincey:** All right.
**Luke Mincey:** It should work.
**Luke Mincey:** Yeah.
**Luke Mincey:** Okay.
**Luke Mincey:** Create password.
**Luke Mincey:** So you just working super long days for this nowadays?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Past.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Past three weeks have been very long because it's like me and Nate have been piling ourselves on with demos.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Thank goodness that Klug has been able.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We call John Klug as well as you probably remember, that's just stationary name.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But so my text.

**Luke Mincey:** Because I assumed you would call him John, but no, yeah, no, no.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm just rolling with, dude.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Nate introduced me and he's like, this is Klug.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And I'm like, all right, this is Clue.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is Mincy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm like, I'm just going with it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Um, but yeah, now with.
**Alex Ciereszko:** With John involved, it's obviously a whole lot easier because he's been taking a huge.
**Alex Ciereszko:** He's been doing great with that stuff, so it helps us.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But there's so much internal payment processors, all the tech behind stuff.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You get it?
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean, that stuff just has.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's been very.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's been a very long day.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then obviously catching up with Klug and getting that stuff sorted is just.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's a lot, you know, but it's gonna.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's gonna get better and better.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Now in the process, we're gonna tighten that up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So.

**Luke Mincey:** Plus, more and more we'll be off share plate.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Exactly.

**Luke Mincey:** And others.
**Luke Mincey:** But.
**Luke Mincey:** One day over here too.
**Luke Mincey:** I was in the office.
**Luke Mincey:** They started at five, so.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So, Luke, tell me about that with your.
**Alex Ciereszko:** With your job right now.

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah, I mean, I'm very easily able to do this Monday, Friday, weekends.
**Luke Mincey:** I mean, I talked to perfect about it.
**Luke Mincey:** It's just Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
**Luke Mincey:** I'm in the office and I wish I was.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Hopefully eventually it won't happen to me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That would be awesome.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, exactly.

**Luke Mincey:** Like, you know, I talked to Klug about it.
**Luke Mincey:** You know, he was showing me and.
**Luke Mincey:** I was watching your videos.
**Luke Mincey:** Like, sells itself.
**Luke Mincey:** It's great.

**Alex Ciereszko:** It really does.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Especially now, Luke, a lot of these people know.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They're already so familiar with a platform like this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They're like, okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Really?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Our biggest bottleneck right now is the support.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, me and Nate have really been spearheading the support and just email people emailing us.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's probably like the hardest thing because people want to know how to use our platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But all of them have like a general understanding.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, nobody's coming in saying, like, what's an intense Signal.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I've never heard of data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, how can I use this?
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Or if even if they haven't used it, they're still like, oh, well, I understand, like running data, you know, like they get part.

**Luke Mincey:** So yeah, and I was playing around with it and it's pretty straightforward.
**Luke Mincey:** It's.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Exactly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then I saw in your video.

**Luke Mincey:** You were talking about the version 2.0 releasing soon and I saw something about like AI in there.
**Luke Mincey:** Like you can just ask the AI.
**Luke Mincey:** Bot to basically generate the list.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, so what?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right now it's in beta mode, Luke.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But once that's launched, you're basically going to be able to go in like chat GBT and say, hey, I need a list of people interested in H Vac near the Dallas zip code.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And it'll just pump that out and you can, you can say exactly what you want it to do.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And it should be doing that right now.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We still recommend people do this on.
**Alex Ciereszko:** On, you know, an actual manual search, as you've seen in the.
**Alex Ciereszko:** In the thing in the videos.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But that'll be.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There's gonna.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're gonna have a separate call on when V2 releases and just the whole everybody in sales.
**Alex Ciereszko:** John Klug, me, like everybody, Nate.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're all going to get on one call and just go through the whole v2 platform and then we'll send you guys that recording to just kind of refer back to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I did just send you your high Level login, so you should have that in your retarget IQ email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just go ahead and log in there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then once you see that email, Luke, just go ahead and share your screen.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll start walking you through the.

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah.
**Luke Mincey:** See where Share screen on Google.
**Luke Mincey:** I think it's this.
**Luke Mincey:** Entire screen.
**Luke Mincey:** Okay, there we go.
**Luke Mincey:** Cool.
**Luke Mincey:** So can't share your screen.
**Luke Mincey:** Hold on.
**Luke Mincey:** Oh, I have to go to system preferences.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Hold on.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If not, I can share mine too.

**Luke Mincey:** Okay.
**Luke Mincey:** Either way, might have to do that.
**Luke Mincey:** Not letting me.
**Luke Mincey:** I need to figure this out.
**Luke Mincey:** Until this is a Google or Apple related.
**Luke Mincey:** Yeah, I might just have to figure this out after the call.
**Luke Mincey:** I don't want to waste too much of your time.
**Luke Mincey:** Oh, you're good.
**Luke Mincey:** You're good.
**Luke Mincey:** It's not letting me share my screen.
**Luke Mincey:** Through Google, so I might just have to.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh good.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Did you get into high Level?

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah.
**Luke Mincey:** So it says sign into your account.
**Luke Mincey:** I guess I'll just do like, do I already have the account or do I need to sign in with Google?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, go ahead and click forgot password, Luke.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then just put in your Luke@retarget IQ email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then it'll pop over in that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** In that Gmail account.

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah, this is not working.
**Luke Mincey:** Hold on.
**Luke Mincey:** So I don't sign in Google.

**Alex Ciereszko:** For high level?
**Alex Ciereszko:** No, it's going to be a separate lion.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But let me know if you have trouble with that, Luke, because what I can do is I can just go in on the back end and I can just change your password manually.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you could just log in that way?

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah, I might have to, because when I click forgot password, it just says the password you picked and it doesn't spur another screen.
**Luke Mincey:** That's interesting.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I wish I could see your screen.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Here, let me do this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me, Let me go to.

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah, I'm gonna have to work this out.
**Luke Mincey:** I need to be able to share my screen.
**Luke Mincey:** Yeah, I got to sit on a call with John, so that was helpful.

**Alex Ciereszko:** All right, so your high level password is going to be Luke Rocks.
**Alex Ciereszko:** One, two, three, exclamation point.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And it's going to be capital L and then capital R for rocks.

**Luke Mincey:** Send a code to my phone.
**Luke Mincey:** Cool.
**Luke Mincey:** All right, I'm in.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So what I'll do, Luke, is let me just share my screen and I'll also send you this recording so you can just see what you have to do to hook up your calendar.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's super simple.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Which one was I on?
**Alex Ciereszko:** All right, so you should probably see something like this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You're just going to go down to Settings and then you're going to see my profile on the left hand side.
**Alex Ciereszko:** When you click on my profile, you can scroll down, you can change your password.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you want to change that one that I just made for you, feel free to just punch in a new password and then click Update.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But when you keep scrolling down, you're going to see something that says like Add new or Connect Calendar.
**Alex Ciereszko:** When you click on that, it's going to be the first top option that lets you sign in to your Google account.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So just sign in with your luke@retargetiq email and then that'll automatically populate to Linked Calendar as well as Conflict Calendar is going to be that one.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I don't know if you use Google Calendar for your other stuff, but like anytime you're busy or something like that, just throw it on that Retarget IQ calendar.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Or like for example, right here under Conflict Calendars, I can just click these and I can also sign in with my other Google Calendar.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So then that way it's talking to the CRM saying, hey, like if for some reason something pops up and you're like, hey, this afternoon.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Even though my availability, which, your availability, if you scroll down more, you can set right here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Even if your availability is jam packed or you know it's open, for example, you can say, hey, 3pm, I gotta go run to the, I don't know, to the gym or the mechanic shop, whatever.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just go in your Google calendar, block that time slot off, it'll automatically block.

**Luke Mincey:** It off for you.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, cool.

**Luke Mincey:** That's straightforward.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So pretty simple stuff.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you have any problems with it, just let me know.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We can also jump on a FaceTime if you have issues with it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That way I can just see your screen and tell you where to click around with it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But that's a general overview of how to work that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then obviously you'll get a text notification every time a demo books with you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So every time your text notification goes off, it'll just let you know.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you know, hey, tomorrow, 3:00pm, I got a demo.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can also go to your calendars and you'll be able to see exactly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is our calendar.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is John's calendar.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let's patch, let's patch my calendar in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's been a crazy week, Luke, but you'll be able to see something a little bit more tame than this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you'll be able to see every single one of your demos.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All the purple ones, those are the actual demos that are popping.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then under opportunities, your pipeline is going to be your own.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So it will not be this messy whatsoever.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay?
**Alex Ciereszko:** The only things you need to worry about is demo booked.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's just say these are, hey, these are my book demos that are coming up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** When you hop a demo, let's say you get off with Aaron, nothing was purchased, but you made him an offer.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You told him about the pricing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just click and hold.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Drag this person over to Verbal offer made.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just keeping you organized that you know, hey, on Verbal offer made, these are the people where I log in and if I have no bookings for two hours, I can sit here and text these people, call these people and follow up with those conversations I've had.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you're on a meeting, you can simply just open one of these.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's say you're on demo.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You just spoke to Aaron and he's like, hey, I'm going to buy it a week.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just click them once.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then in the notes tab you can literally just add a note.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Hey, Aaron was interested in this and this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** He's in the real estate field.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Reach back out to him and Then put yourself like the date of that week.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So reach back a week after January 28th week.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Super straightforward.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then just save it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Your demo completed, this is automatically going to move over.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you don't move people from demo book to demo completed, it'll automatically move these people.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Anybody who misses or needs to reschedule a demo, it will automatically populate in here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then let's say someone closes on the call.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You literally just click and drag them over into closed and then drop them in there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The only other thing that you really need to know about Luke is your lost opportunity.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let's say you're calling one of these people that you know made a verbal offer or missed and or missed the demo and didn't reschedule.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is both, but let's just say it's one of them that just missed it and didn't show up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you're calling them and they're like, hey, never call me again, just grab them, drop them in the lost.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Other than that, I mean pretty straightforward.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I do like to click on my calendars as well and just go up top to the appointment list view.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then I know we haven't been doing this because we've been super busy, but just going in on the confirmed section, if someone doesn't show, I click no show.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's say you have an appointment at 3 o', clock, you know, in the afternoon.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All of a sudden it's 3:05.
**Alex Ciereszko:** No one's showing up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I usually give them a call, shoot them a text.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If no response happens by 3:10, I just hop off the meeting and mark them as a no show.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There's been plenty of times where people join in at 304, 305, you know, so just be mindful of that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But the minute you put no show, it's going to automatically move this lead into the demo.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Missed or rescheduled portion the opportunity.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So yeah, other than that, man, like new lead, this isn't going to matter because the only time we're capturing the lead at this point, this was still when we were doing lead forms.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Now it's going directly to a booking page.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if they don't book, it's just not even going to show up as a lead.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Don't have to worry about lead responded really interested.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You don't have to worry about.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's literally I'm logging in the morning or whenever and I'm taking a look.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, I got these demos booked, going to knock those out.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I got these completed ones or Missed ones that haven't been reached out to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm just going to hose through this pipeline and clean these up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's what I love it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Only other thing is your conversations pretty self explanatory.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can play around with this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You're going to be able to go in and see exactly like for example, if I click on all, they're only going to be your assigned contacts.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can just respond to people and go through each one that you missed or may have not responded to.

**Luke Mincey:** Is this like their phone number?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, so this is both their phone number.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Here, let me hide this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you actually have the option where I can type a message right now and send them an sms, or I can switch it to email and directly email them.

**Luke Mincey:** Okay, that's nice.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yep.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you can do either or.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then if you look like these ones have the text, you know, these are emails.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, so you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is messy, man, because I see everything that's going on, so it's not going to look this way.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** For example, these guys, you know, hey, Ben, your.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Your Demo starts in 30 minutes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can go in, punch in a text if someone's not showing up, and then hop back into your meeting like this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, that's just how I usually do it.

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah.
**Luke Mincey:** So is it just you and Klug.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Handling this right now?
**Alex Ciereszko:** So it's me, Klug, Nate.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We had a guy, Chad, who's stepping away.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then we have Trevor, if you know Trevor.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yep, exactly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So he's.
**Alex Ciereszko:** He's rocking and rolling too.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then we have a girl we're training as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Did this just move?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, it must have been this guy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But yeah, so it's us.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then for right now, I think we're going to be good on reps, but we're going to be scaling this budget pretty quick.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we're trying to really get this calendar busy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, if we can get everybody doing five to ten calls a day on their available days, we're going to be closing a lot of people.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then, I don't know.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't know, Luke, if Klug mentioned, but we have a support email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's say somebody is on the call and they're like, awesome, I'm ready to start.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me ask you this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Do you have the payment pricing guide sheet with all the.

**Luke Mincey:** You mean the calculator or.

**Alex Ciereszko:** No, just the actual stripe links?

**Luke Mincey:** No, I don't.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, let me get that over to you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Give me two seconds.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think it's in my drive.

**Luke Mincey:** You Change the prices now.
**Luke Mincey:** Right.
**Luke Mincey:** So it's like a thousand or 997.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Shortly rock with these prices because we still have like 2ish.
**Alex Ciereszko:** A little over two weeks before new stuff comes out.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let me add.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me send this over to you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is our current pricing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Luke at Retarget maybe not two T's.

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** There we go.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll do it as viewer just so you don't hit a button by accident because we had that happen.

**Luke Mincey:** Perfect.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'm going to send that over to you so you will have that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is our current pricing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you go into it, you're going to see every single link.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you're on a call and they're like, hey, we just want to do the monthly plan, but we want to add VIP support.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Guess what?

**Luke Mincey:** Boom.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Monthly with vip, everything's included.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And I'm actually going to put a pricing tag here too, Luke, just so you can tell them like, hey, it's 750 or it's a thousand and ten dollars or whatever.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It is all you have to do after that when you go in your email, literally go in and punch in info at okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And just you could do something like new, new sign up.

**Luke Mincey:** And is this the one that goes to Cindy?
**Luke Mincey:** Is that her name?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, she is.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Any kind of person you want to make her, AKA it's me, Nate and Klug just working that back end email.

**Luke Mincey:** Oh, oh, I thought it was actually an employee.

**Alex Ciereszko:** No, dude, we need to find some.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The problem is Luke is like training someone on doing exactly what we do is very hard because the front end is a lot to learn, the back end is a ton more to learn.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So right now it's as we're training one of our.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's actually one of my girls from a marketing company.
**Alex Ciereszko:** She's just going to step over and do this full time.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But literally just put in Retarget IQ team and then just use their email that they want to sign up with.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So, you know, let's say it's luke@retargetiq.com.
**Alex Ciereszko:** perfect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This guy wants to sign up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Sweet.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then all I ever have to say is just, hi, Cindy, you know, this guy wants to sign up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Please set up his account as soon as possible.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is the email he would like to use.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's all you got to do.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then we take care of the logins, the sign up and all the support after that on the back end.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So it's pretty straightforward.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And this will get easier too, Luke.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like we're Already working on setting up ways where we can have this kind of stuff sent with AI and just not have it, you know, make it easier on you guys.

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah, I mean, it's not.

**Alex Ciereszko:** But for right now, it should be pretty straightforward.

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah, my Google calendar has been hitting the circle over here for.

**Alex Ciereszko:** It's gonna do that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's gonna do that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just click out of it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So, like, out of that little box and then it should say reconnect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** In that same spot.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It'll say, like, reconnect calendar.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Go ahead and hit that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It should be, like, 10 seconds.

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah, man.
**Luke Mincey:** So I might text Klug, see if I can go over to his place, like, tomorrow night and just, like, walk through the pool.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Cool.
**Alex Ciereszko:** With him for sure.

**Luke Mincey:** Just figure everything out and then.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, and if you guys have any questions, just ping me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Same with, like, your calendar setup.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Did it connect for you, Luke?

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Luke Mincey:** I mean, I figured, like, I might X out and then it would work, but.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, it was weird.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It did the same thing for Trevor.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I literally just got off a call with Trevor.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's why it took me a second here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But, yeah, if you guys have any questions, Klug knows, you know, in and out, everything.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So just let me know if you guys have anything you want to go over, and then your high level should be all good.
**Alex Ciereszko:** When you're ready, just let us know.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Klug will probably tell me, and we'll just go in and add you to the round robin, and you'll start getting demo smacked on your calendar.

**Luke Mincey:** Yeah, man, sounds great.
**Luke Mincey:** Appreciate it.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Of course.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll talk to you soon.

**Luke Mincey:** Anytime.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, for sure.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you have any issues, just let me know.
