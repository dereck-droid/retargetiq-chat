## Transcript

**Robert Lozano:** Sir.

**Harsh Bembi:** I'm here, guys.
**Harsh Bembi:** What's up?

**Cameron Colby:** Perfect.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Talk to me, guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** What do we want to do?

**Harsh Bembi:** I thought we talked real quick that day about the semi blue tight stuff.
**Harsh Bembi:** So I brought my guy on that.
**Harsh Bembi:** He handles all the semi glue tights for the clinics and the price appetite.
**Harsh Bembi:** So I figured what you're telling me is not going to help.
**Harsh Bembi:** So I brought Robert on.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, Robert.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just for background, you know, one of the Marsh's friends, Nate.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm business partners with Nate, and we're running a really big data company right now.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But my background and I still do dabble in the marketing space for med spas.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That led me to go and resell the medication and connect people with.
**Alex Ciereszko:** With pharmacies.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I get a really good price on it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And that's why, you know, I was telling Harsh.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I hear that you guys are doing 503A.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Not sure why you're not doing 503B.

**Robert Lozano:** But we have both.
**Robert Lozano:** We have both.
**Robert Lozano:** Yeah.

**Nate Calhoun:** Okay.

**Robert Lozano:** Yeah, we go through Anna SEO.
**Robert Lozano:** Actually.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm sorry, could you repeat that?

**Robert Lozano:** We go through NSA right now.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, got it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And how much are you guys paying?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, what makes you guys stick to the 503A or the 503B?
**Alex Ciereszko:** What.
**Alex Ciereszko:** What's going on there?

**Robert Lozano:** Well, nothing's really sticking me.
**Robert Lozano:** What I'm looking for is.
**Robert Lozano:** Well, I need something.
**Robert Lozano:** That one.
**Robert Lozano:** I've been approached by people who, you know, say you can get it for me, but then when they present it to me, it has the little disclaimer about, you know, not FDA approved, not intended for human or animal use.
**Robert Lozano:** I need, you know, anaceo has been legit, you know, where we don't have that issue.
**Robert Lozano:** We also signed a contract with Dr. Well, I don't know if you heard of that or not.
**Robert Lozano:** It's like a subscription.
**Robert Lozano:** They basically take care of everything for us.
**Robert Lozano:** Patient goes and signs up, pays a subscription price.
**Robert Lozano:** Then they send the medication to us and we distribute it there.
**Robert Lozano:** But what we're trying to get away from is that and trying to do.
**Robert Lozano:** We've realized that trying to do a monthly thing doesn't work for everyone.
**Robert Lozano:** Some people like to just pay by the week.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Got it.

**Robert Lozano:** So I.
**Robert Lozano:** We're looking to purchase, you know, a bulk amount where we can distribute it to our patients as they progress, you know, from starting to wherever they plateau and stay at.

**Nate Calhoun:** Got it.

**Robert Lozano:** So both Semi Blue Tide and Tirzepatite.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then when you guys are doing the weekly.

**Nate Calhoun:** Go ahead, Rob.

**Robert Lozano:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Robert Lozano:** No, go ahead.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So when you guys are when you guys are doing, like, what.
**Alex Ciereszko:** What's keeping you guys on the 503A or the 503B?

**Robert Lozano:** Just being able to get the medication, that's all.

**Cameron Colby:** Got it.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I just sent over one of my reps, Cam.
**Alex Ciereszko:** He's been pushing all the 503B.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I. I personally am a fan of 503B, Rob, because we actually use it from a licensed and accredited pharmacy.

**Harsh Bembi:** So this isn't 503B, guys, from my knowledge.

**Robert Lozano:** So it's.

**Alex Ciereszko:** It's basically bulk.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So instead of Harsh, getting a single specific 503A patient for, let's say, Rob or Harsh or Alex, and it's just their vial, you're getting a vial that's filled with, you know, let's say 20 milligrams of semaglutide and 75 milligrams of something like tirzepatide.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Guys, this is Cameron.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Cameron, I know this is really abrupt, but harsh.
**Alex Ciereszko:** A mutual business partner here, through the data, had connected me with.
**Alex Ciereszko:** With Robert, and I just totally forgot about it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And I was like, hey, you know what?
**Alex Ciereszko:** I need to bring Cam in here too, so you guys can just chat about what we got going on with the GLPs.

**Cameron Colby:** Sounds good.
**Cameron Colby:** Appreciate you guys bringing me in.
**Cameron Colby:** Cam, Colby.
**Cameron Colby:** Nice to meet you.

**Robert Lozano:** Yeah, hi, I'm Robert.

**Harsh Bembi:** Nice to meet you.

**Robert Lozano:** So basically, what we're looking for is to purchase it bulk, as long as it makes sense.
**Robert Lozano:** And being able to do it weekly for our patients versus monthly.
**Robert Lozano:** We don't ship it to the patients.
**Robert Lozano:** They actually come into our office to receive the injections or, you know, pick up their monthly amount and then go home.
**Robert Lozano:** We do require them every month to come in to see us, you know, do the weights.
**Robert Lozano:** Everything else helps.
**Robert Lozano:** You know, my medical director, Hirsch's brother is very much by the book, so, you know, he doesn't sidetrack.
**Robert Lozano:** And I've been approached by a lot of companies that say they have the legit, you know, hookup, and they can do this and that, and, you know, it never ends up that way.
**Robert Lozano:** It always is a medication that's.
**Robert Lozano:** They say it's semi glutai, but it.
**Robert Lozano:** I. I couldn't tell you if it was or not.
**Robert Lozano:** A lot of it has disclaimers on the bottle saying, you know, not FDA approved, not intended for animal or human use.
**Robert Lozano:** I can't really present that to my patients.
**Robert Lozano:** You know, that's why we've stayed with NSAO for as long as we have.
**Robert Lozano:** All through.
**Robert Lozano:** Dr. Well, and that's why.

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah, no it makes sense.
**Cameron Colby:** I appreciate you sharing that with me.
**Cameron Colby:** You know, one of the things I've been in the medical space now for just about 10 years and one of the things that I found absolutely crazy over the last two years is all the misleading that does go on with the, you know, especially with the GLPs.
**Cameron Colby:** And now you've got all these, know, different powders and people will say, I've got this pharmacy, that pharmacy.
**Cameron Colby:** And then you make an order and you're like, wait a second, this is a research use only.
**Cameron Colby:** So my business partner, I'll show you.

**Robert Lozano:** I mean I've got, I got this in the mail.

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah.

**Robert Lozano:** And there's nothing on it.
**Robert Lozano:** Like I don't know what it is.
**Robert Lozano:** I don't even know how to reconstitute it if, if I had to.

**Cameron Colby:** Right.

**Robert Lozano:** You know, and this was more rep.
**Robert Lozano:** So that's what I'm, you know, saying.
**Robert Lozano:** I, I get hit up a lot and we have a lot of patients.
**Robert Lozano:** But the reason we haven't moved away From Anaceo and Dr. Well is for this reason.
**Robert Lozano:** For that reason.

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah, yeah.
**Cameron Colby:** And I can actually send Alex a picture of one of the bottles that we use.
**Cameron Colby:** So my business partner actually owns multiple weight loss clinics.
**Cameron Colby:** That's how Alex and I got introduced is that Alex was doing the marketing with my business partner.
**Cameron Colby:** And Alex can talk to you more about kind of what his background is, but he's got 17 different businesses outside of the medical field.
**Cameron Colby:** This was just kind of a, a fun tax write off for him, if you will.
**Cameron Colby:** And so the reason why him and I decided to go into business together and get a contract with a legitimate 503B source.
**Cameron Colby:** And we're onboarding a couple of a sources as well for telemedicine clinics and things like that was because he same thing happened to him.
**Cameron Colby:** And I may or may not have pointed out to him, hey, you shouldn't do that if you don't want to sacrifice everything else with all your other businesses.
**Cameron Colby:** Called me the next day and said, let's do this because there's a lot of shady, just misunderstanding in this space.
**Cameron Colby:** So.
**Cameron Colby:** So anyways, with that being said, we do have a consistent 503B source.
**Cameron Colby:** We have, you know, hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of bottles in inventory right now.
**Cameron Colby:** And our partner pharmacy is.
**Cameron Colby:** They'll never pick up the phone if you call them.
**Cameron Colby:** They only work with, you know, major distributors.

**Robert Lozano:** That's how most of them are.
**Robert Lozano:** Yeah.
**Robert Lozano:** The company that we with, Anna Sale, they actually go through Red Rock in Utah.

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah.

**Robert Lozano:** And they wouldn't talk to me even if I wanted to.
**Robert Lozano:** So I have to go through.
**Robert Lozano:** Dr. Well.
**Robert Lozano:** In order, you know, to get that conversation.

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah, we can definitely.
**Cameron Colby:** Alex, if you could connect us in like a group email or, or something.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, absolutely.

**Cameron Colby:** More than happy to provide you with that.
**Cameron Colby:** But the nice thing is, as I'm sure you're well aware with B, you know, you don't have to, you know, write all the prescriptions and everything else.
**Cameron Colby:** So.

**Robert Lozano:** Yeah, that's what we're kind of looking at.
**Robert Lozano:** You know, like I said, we want to go to.
**Robert Lozano:** We're looking to go where we can do something weekly.
**Robert Lozano:** I'm not tied into patient specific ordering.
**Robert Lozano:** You know, it makes it much easier.
**Robert Lozano:** You know, like I said, Alex, you know, prescriptions start off like at 399 and work their way up just kind of depending on what dose and strength and.
**Robert Lozano:** And it's a lot for some people to come up at one time, but when I break it down and say, Hey, $50 a week, that's more manageable to people and they're more willing to do it.
**Robert Lozano:** Yeah.
**Robert Lozano:** So, you know, that's kind of where we want to be.

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Cameron Colby:** And we're happy to provide you with any and all that documentation.
**Cameron Colby:** I see some emails coming through right now, so I'll, I'll save those.

**Harsh Bembi:** I just, I just put it on the chat, my email and Robert's email.

**Cameron Colby:** Perfect.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Thank you, Marsh.

**Cameron Colby:** Perfect.
**Cameron Colby:** Just out of curiosity, I assume you're probably doing primarily terzepatide at this point.
**Cameron Colby:** Is that fair to say?

**Robert Lozano:** No.
**Robert Lozano:** You know what, I have more of a fallen for semi glutide than I do for tirzepatite.
**Robert Lozano:** You know, I don't know if it's more because it costs or what, but I have a lot of people lose light of weight on semaglutide.
**Robert Lozano:** Hers has done pretty well on it.
**Robert Lozano:** Quite a few people that you know.
**Robert Lozano:** But we have transitioned some.
**Robert Lozano:** My brother's one that transition from semi glutide to tirzepatite and he's doing a lot better on tirzepatite.
**Robert Lozano:** I, I think it just comes up each individual person.
**Robert Lozano:** Some people do well on semi, others don't.

**Alex Ciereszko:** It's.

**Cameron Colby:** I just pulled up your website real quick here in the background.
**Cameron Colby:** I see.
**Cameron Colby:** Looks like you have some, some different.
**Cameron Colby:** You know, you have an aesthetic center.
**Cameron Colby:** And I spend a lot of time in the aesthetics industry and it's so funny to your point, you know, you've got certain people that'll come in for one laser procedure.
**Cameron Colby:** They get one treatment done.
**Cameron Colby:** It's the greatest result they've ever seen, you know, and then you go to the next person and they get six treatments done, and it doesn't work.
**Cameron Colby:** Right.
**Cameron Colby:** Everybody's body is different.
**Cameron Colby:** So a lot of.
**Cameron Colby:** And a lot of tures on a weekly basis.
**Cameron Colby:** Because you said you like to order weekly, which is totally fine.
**Cameron Colby:** One of our unique value propositions is not only that we have the direct access to 503B, but also that, you know, we don't require minimum orders.
**Cameron Colby:** So even if.

**Harsh Bembi:** Well, we would buy.

**Robert Lozano:** We would buy in bulk.
**Robert Lozano:** We want to be able to provide to the patients weekly.
**Robert Lozano:** So it would be, you know, it would be bulk.
**Robert Lozano:** It would be enough to take care of all those patients, at least monthly.

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
**Cameron Colby:** So right now, our semaglutide bottles are 20 milligram bottles, and then our tirzepatide bottles, we have a methylated B12 option that's a 68 milligram.
**Cameron Colby:** And then we have a cyanocobalamin option as well at 75 milligrams.
**Cameron Colby:** It's the same price for both.
**Cameron Colby:** Both different versions of Tirzepatide.
**Cameron Colby:** But just out of curiosity, I mean, if you're buying weekly to take care of those patients, I mean, do you have a general idea of how much you'd want to buy?
**Cameron Colby:** Because I've got a little volume discount calculator over here at this moment.

**Robert Lozano:** Probably not.
**Robert Lozano:** It would be.
**Robert Lozano:** I mean, we have quite.
**Robert Lozano:** Quite a few patients on it, right, Hirsch?

**Harsh Bembi:** Yeah, we do.
**Harsh Bembi:** And I don't know the math.
**Harsh Bembi:** I have to go back, figure out how much can you get out of a gram bottle?
**Harsh Bembi:** How many shots?

**Robert Lozano:** Well, right now, it's individual, so, I mean, it's.

**Harsh Bembi:** I mean, does anybody have the map?
**Harsh Bembi:** You guys have it, like, what, a 20 milligram bottle?
**Harsh Bembi:** How many shots can you get of what dosage point?
**Harsh Bembi:** Half 1.25 or 1.5, because.
**Harsh Bembi:** Yeah, different levels.
**Harsh Bembi:** Right.
**Harsh Bembi:** Somebody's start off at 0.25, then half 1, 1.75, then 2.5.
**Harsh Bembi:** Same thing for semi glutide.
**Harsh Bembi:** 2.5, I think 5, 7.5, and 10.
**Harsh Bembi:** So I will need the math.
**Harsh Bembi:** What that bottle can draw.

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah, I mean, I mean, very simply, you know, obviously, if.
**Cameron Colby:** And I always try to look at, like, a medium shot, because people will go up.
**Cameron Colby:** Right.
**Cameron Colby:** So, like, with semaglutide, I usually base it off of 1mg shots, but obviously got.
**Cameron Colby:** I mean, so then you've got 20 shots in each bottle with the semi Bottles.
**Cameron Colby:** And then, you know, tirzepatide at 75 milligrams divided by 2.5, I believe that is 20.
**Cameron Colby:** 20 milli.
**Cameron Colby:** Or, sorry, 20 shots.
**Cameron Colby:** So it'd be roughly, you know, roughly 20ish shots per bottle.
**Cameron Colby:** But.

**Harsh Bembi:** But the pricing, I could do the math.
**Harsh Bembi:** I'm the number guy.
**Harsh Bembi:** I can figure all that out.
**Harsh Bembi:** What we'll need is.
**Harsh Bembi:** I'll get.
**Harsh Bembi:** If you give me, like, forget the volume design.
**Harsh Bembi:** If you give me a pricing and give me a ballpark, then I can tell you what we'll be ordering monthly.

**Cameron Colby:** Yes.
**Cameron Colby:** And y' all are lucky, because I. I did make a commitment to Alex that as long as we can make it make sense, I'll always take care of his customers whenever he sends them our way.
**Cameron Colby:** So.

**Harsh Bembi:** Yeah, your bottle.
**Harsh Bembi:** Can we get a picture of your bottle?
**Harsh Bembi:** It doesn't say anything like, do not use on animals or anything like that, bro.
**Harsh Bembi:** Right.

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah, no, absolutely.
**Cameron Colby:** Every one of our DLP bottles comes with an FDA lot number on there that you can actually go on fda.gov and you can search a lot.
**Cameron Colby:** You wanted to.
**Cameron Colby:** And we have coas available for every one of those as well.
**Cameron Colby:** So I'll send over just kind of like a general pricing list.
**Cameron Colby:** So just so you know, we start at $7amilligram.
**Cameron Colby:** Sorry, I've got someone working on the house over here.
**Cameron Colby:** If that's too loud, you're fine.
**Cameron Colby:** Okay.

**Harsh Bembi:** I would like to get with this sooner.
**Harsh Bembi:** The pricing makes sense.
**Harsh Bembi:** Robert, what's our rule coming up with these guys?

**Robert Lozano:** I'm not sure yet.
**Robert Lozano:** I gotta reach out to him today.
**Robert Lozano:** I haven't had.

**Harsh Bembi:** I want an email sent out today before they renew it, please.
**Harsh Bembi:** Because they won't refund the money.
**Harsh Bembi:** Yeah, yeah, that's the priority, Robert.

**Robert Lozano:** Yeah, no problem.
**Robert Lozano:** I got you.

**Harsh Bembi:** We talked about it yesterday, so I do want that sent out.

**Robert Lozano:** Yeah, right now it's.
**Robert Lozano:** We get it with glycine.

**Cameron Colby:** Okay.

**Robert Lozano:** That's how it comes to me.
**Robert Lozano:** So I know it has to be mixed with something just to fit the rules.
**Robert Lozano:** So.

**Harsh Bembi:** What is your mix with.

**Cameron Colby:** So.
**Cameron Colby:** And Alex can talk to you about this a little bit, too, because he's worked with so many clinics.
**Cameron Colby:** Our partner pharmacy, they choose to mix it with B12, whether it's methylated or non methylated.
**Cameron Colby:** And we've seen.
**Cameron Colby:** I mean, that's what we use in.
**Cameron Colby:** In our part.
**Cameron Colby:** You know, my.
**Cameron Colby:** My business partner's clinics, and he's treated thousands of patients.
**Cameron Colby:** We get really, really good patient feedback with that, too.
**Cameron Colby:** So.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, that's pretty much the Most popular one guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't know about you guys but I, I have had.

**Robert Lozano:** We actually give, yeah we actually do B12 with as one of the shots.
**Robert Lozano:** So mixing it would make sense to us.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, perfect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, that's, that's a majority Rob.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean I've worked with over 100 clinics now there, there's probably 10 of them that are like bought it from a bad person, from a bad batch, from a research grade company and then they're complaining that B12 doesn't work and it's like well no wonder.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's probably not B12 in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's probably red 40.

**Robert Lozano:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Robert Lozano:** Like I said there's a lot of, a lot of unscrupulous people out there.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Absolutely.

**Cameron Colby:** And then the nice thing for you guys too is literally yesterday we launched a HIPAA compliant website ordering website that has live active inventory levels for all of our products.
**Cameron Colby:** And we're integrating an entire Peptides offering as well through a physician use only, you know, peptide supplier that is actually a co partner with one of the most famous, his name is Dr. Joe Story.
**Cameron Colby:** He's, he's out of Alabama and northern Florida here but he's one of the most well known regenerative medicine doctors in the country.
**Cameron Colby:** And so anyways, with that being said, we have that, that's getting integrated into the platform but we have that entire product offering as well.
**Cameron Colby:** So any of the major peptide offerings if that's something that you all want to explore here in the near future.
**Cameron Colby:** So what I'm doing right now for most of my clients is I'm actually just doing the orders for you.
**Cameron Colby:** You'll receive an email with an invoice link.
**Cameron Colby:** Once I place the order you can go in and put in the payment information.
**Cameron Colby:** As soon as the payment information is in there, you will receive in your portal, which I'll walk you through.
**Cameron Colby:** If this decides to work out, what I'll do is I'll walk you through kind of where to go find the tracking number and usually anytime that an order is put in before, you know, noon eastern, it should, that order should be generating a tracking number and going out that day.
**Cameron Colby:** So typically on a day where half the country isn't frozen, we look at a 24 hour turnaround time but kind of guarantee 48.
**Cameron Colby:** So.

**Robert Lozano:** Okay, that will work definitely.

**Harsh Bembi:** If you can email us the like a little bit of passing a picture of the bottle, I can have a meeting with our is my brother but Dr. Benby tomorrow and say this might be easier.
**Harsh Bembi:** If it's B12 we don't need to get B12s anymore, so.
**Harsh Bembi:** And if this pricing makes sense to us, I think we will want to go down this way.
**Harsh Bembi:** But we weren't gonna move on this quick, believe me.
**Harsh Bembi:** I'm not gonna keep you guys hanging on this.

**Cameron Colby:** We'll get it to you as soon as I'm off the call.
**Cameron Colby:** I'll drop an email for you and then we'll go from there.

**Harsh Bembi:** Yep, sounds good.

**Robert Lozano:** Okay, guys.
**Robert Lozano:** Yep.
**Robert Lozano:** We'll definitely be in touch with you then.

**Cameron Colby:** Awesome, guys.
**Cameron Colby:** Thank you, gentlemen.

**Robert Lozano:** Thank you.

**Harsh Bembi:** Hold on.
**Harsh Bembi:** This is not off the.
**Harsh Bembi:** The semi blue stuff.
**Harsh Bembi:** Let's go back to the other stuff.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, with Nathan.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll get him on the call.

**Harsh Bembi:** No, no, we don't need Nathan today.
**Harsh Bembi:** I have to head out too.
**Harsh Bembi:** This is more important.
**Harsh Bembi:** I've got to pick up the kids.
**Harsh Bembi:** That's why I was talking to him yesterday.
**Harsh Bembi:** He's partying in Hawaii, so I don't know what he's.
**Harsh Bembi:** If he's actually working.
**Harsh Bembi:** So don't even follow.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I promise you he is working his butt off.

**Cameron Colby:** Cam can can attest.

**Nate Calhoun:** Hey, there he is.

**Alex Ciereszko:** He's working.

**Harsh Bembi:** He's there with Harvey.
**Harsh Bembi:** He's full of.
**Harsh Bembi:** He's not working.

**Robert Lozano:** Just.

**Harsh Bembi:** That's working, right?
**Harsh Bembi:** That's working.

**Robert Lozano:** Yeah.

**Harsh Bembi:** We can't even hear you, bro.
**Harsh Bembi:** I know.

**Cameron Colby:** I'll get to work on that message.

**Harsh Bembi:** You're on mute.
**Harsh Bembi:** Nathan, can you hear me?

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah.

**Harsh Bembi:** Okay.
**Harsh Bembi:** Hey, maybe we can set the call next week.
**Harsh Bembi:** I kind of want to talk about what got my interest was the marketing for our Botox clinic or looking into and you have a data company we use today mailchimp to send out emails and stuff.
**Harsh Bembi:** But then last week I was talking to Nathan.
**Harsh Bembi:** He said you guys have better way of doing it.
**Harsh Bembi:** So anyways, I've not explored into the marketing of the Botox clinic completely but my brother's not after me what we could do and I'll leave Robert for that meeting.
**Harsh Bembi:** I actually guys, I'm sorry.
**Harsh Bembi:** I've only got a couple of minutes.
**Harsh Bembi:** I got to pick up kids by 3:15.
**Harsh Bembi:** I wish we could continue this today, but Alex, we do need to meet.
**Harsh Bembi:** I kind of want to hear your product out for how you can help us market my medical weight loss especially the semi glutath plus plus we do a lot of stuff.
**Harsh Bembi:** We do botox, we do filler.
**Harsh Bembi:** This machine that we have for that's not doing too well for us because I don't think we're marketing it.
**Harsh Bembi:** What is that machine called?
**Harsh Bembi:** Robert that he bought?

**Robert Lozano:** Robert.

**Harsh Bembi:** I'M forgetting the name of this machine.
**Harsh Bembi:** It's for muscle.
**Harsh Bembi:** Yeah, there you go.
**Harsh Bembi:** That's the one I'm not.
**Harsh Bembi:** I'm more involved in the urgent cares and the family practice Pediatrics, where Robert is more of the lead guy on my.
**Harsh Bembi:** On the med spa stuff.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'd be happy with Nate.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We can set up a time.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We've had a crazy week, but I'd.

**Cameron Colby:** Be happy to set up a time.

**Alex Ciereszko:** The three of us even and even with Rob and just go through.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, I'm not officially a consultant, but I've seen enough of this stuff play out where I know what should be done in a med spa for you guys to push it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'd be happy to walk you through that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Whether it's marketing, you know, we've been very tough on time, but since you know, Nate, I'd be happy to take that on as well and put my ads guys on it.

**Cameron Colby:** Yeah.

**Nate Calhoun:** Well, Hersh, what we would do is Ben and I would handle the website and SEO, and then we would let Alex's team just do all the ad stuff, and then we can show you the data stuff as well.

**Harsh Bembi:** Robert, do you want to see that tool?
**Harsh Bembi:** If he wants to join in the meeting?
**Harsh Bembi:** Because he'll probably have.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm sure he will, but time.

**Harsh Bembi:** Because he's been really.
**Harsh Bembi:** After that how we could do something better to market that side of that business.
**Harsh Bembi:** So, yeah, I'll tell him what I.
**Harsh Bembi:** That I met with a couple guys.
**Harsh Bembi:** I think there's a scope.
**Harsh Bembi:** We could try it out if you guys can coordinate out.
**Harsh Bembi:** If I can join.
**Harsh Bembi:** Guys, I'll join, but Robert, I'll.
**Harsh Bembi:** I've got you guys in contact to take this lead from here.

**Robert Lozano:** Okay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** All right.

**Robert Lozano:** Sounds good.
**Robert Lozano:** All right.

**Nate Calhoun:** Thanks, Robert.

**Robert Lozano:** Yeah, no problem.
**Robert Lozano:** We, you know, we need some help in that department, definitely.
**Robert Lozano:** And I have a.
**Robert Lozano:** We have a clinic that's a smaller clinic in our Encinitas area.
**Robert Lozano:** And it really needs some help.
**Robert Lozano:** I mean, I.
**Robert Lozano:** It could be really big if we had some help in that area.
**Robert Lozano:** So I need to keep my boss happy, this guy that's on the camera here with you, so he's not yelling at me, so.

**Cameron Colby:** Oh, he.

**Nate Calhoun:** He's crazy, isn't he?

**Robert Lozano:** Yes, he is.

**Nate Calhoun:** The good kind of crazy, though, at least, right?

**Robert Lozano:** Yeah.

**Harsh Bembi:** The reason I'm saying I'm going to port a wire to next week on Monday.
**Harsh Bembi:** So I know if you guys can.
