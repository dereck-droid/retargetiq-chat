## Transcript

**Jon Kluger:** Jim, I'm here.
**Jon Kluger:** Fantastic.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's see.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, I got this.
**Jon Kluger:** All right, we're in New Jersey.
**Jon Kluger:** Is that a client or are you based out of New Jersey?

**Coach Jim:** All right, let me give you a quick backdrop from the roof inside.
**Coach Jim:** We own a 22 million dollar roofing company.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, wow.

**Coach Jim:** We, we do business in nine states.
**Coach Jim:** All right.
**Coach Jim:** Plus I am a doctor.
**Coach Jim:** I have a medical practice.
**Coach Jim:** Well.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, wow.

**Coach Jim:** And we've already met with Audience Lab.
**Coach Jim:** All right.
**Coach Jim:** I really like how they're very finite in their ability to do keyword search terms.
**Coach Jim:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Yes, sir.

**Coach Jim:** Our idea is to a, not only use this for the medical company as well as the roofing company, but then sell it to other doctors and sell it to other roofing companies.
**Coach Jim:** Okay.
**Coach Jim:** Now my problem with the previous people I met with that retarget IQ is when they did the search in front of me, it wasn't narrowed down enough.
**Coach Jim:** I believe all they did was put in roofing as a search term.
**Coach Jim:** And I mean it came up with 20,000 leads in the past week in the state of New Jersey.
**Coach Jim:** I think that's an overkill.
**Coach Jim:** So the real question is, as you read that email, is can we now win on search terms?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we have room repair, as you see, if we, if you want to use specific phrasing and we go live with V2 February 15, which will allow for you to put any search term for an intent topic.
**Jon Kluger:** We just wanted to, for our first batch for V1 of the platform, we wanted to kind of make it, I hate to say this kind of idiot proof.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is we've noticed that when people put in search terms, they don't necessarily consider how people are searching, they think what they think people are searching.
**Jon Kluger:** And a lot of the time our assumptions aren't always correct.
**Jon Kluger:** I've spent the last decade working with AI and data companies, worked at billion dollar companies, leading the organization in terms of business development and sales.
**Jon Kluger:** And I can tell you each and every time that essentially you need to have a platform that allows for you, yes, to have free form, input, but also constraints and guides.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I was able to do is pull up Roof Repair New Jersey.
**Jon Kluger:** And yes, they are a homeowner, so I'm looking only for homeowners.
**Jon Kluger:** This is going to narrow down that search more.
**Jon Kluger:** What I can tell you, Jim, the reason that partnering with us versus Audience Lab is going to benefit you in the long run is we don't put caps.
**Jon Kluger:** What I mean by that is.

**Coach Jim:** All right, John, let's not get off the things that are unimportant at this point.
**Coach Jim:** Okay.
**Coach Jim:** Let's get back to search terms.
**Coach Jim:** That's the only thing that's important.
**Coach Jim:** We can't.
**Coach Jim:** We can't get through that barrier.
**Coach Jim:** Everything else we have to say is irrelevant.
**Coach Jim:** Now you rent.
**Coach Jim:** You ran a search term roof repair.
**Coach Jim:** I got zero interest in roof repair.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Coach Jim:** You mentioned that there's going to be a date where we're able to put in any keyword search.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**Coach Jim:** What date is that?

**Jon Kluger:** February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now what we're doing is we're offering V1 prices.
**Jon Kluger:** And anyone that signs before February 6th will blow into V2 and grandfathered in with.
**Jon Kluger:** With that price.

**Coach Jim:** I appreciate it, but that ain't gonna happen.
**Coach Jim:** Okay.
**Coach Jim:** I say we reconvene after February 15th.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** All right.

**Coach Jim:** Because we.
**Coach Jim:** If we have the inability to put in the search terms that we want to put in and I could actually make a list for you and email it if you like, please.
**Coach Jim:** And if we can't come up with.
**Coach Jim:** And we'll make it easy, maybe 10 search terms.
**Coach Jim:** Okay.
**Coach Jim:** And come up with an accurate, more realistic quantity.
**Coach Jim:** And it's really no reason to go any further.

**Jon Kluger:** I understand.

**Coach Jim:** So let's book meeting the week of the 15th sometime.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** You want to do this exact same time on the 16th or it's President's Day.
**Jon Kluger:** But if you're.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're going to be online, I'll be online.

**Coach Jim:** I've been working seven days a week for the last 42 years, my friend.

**Jon Kluger:** Hey, that's.
**Jon Kluger:** I appreciate that.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm starting to get there.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll go ahead this on the 16th of February.

**Coach Jim:** Oh, wait, that's a Monday.
**Coach Jim:** That's big patient day for me.
**Coach Jim:** I see about 25 patients on Mondays.

**Jon Kluger:** No problem.
**Jon Kluger:** What day works better for you, sir?

**Coach Jim:** Let's go Tuesday the 17th, early morning.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** How early?

**Coach Jim:** I can do 8am I.

**Jon Kluger:** Fantastic.
**Jon Kluger:** Jim just sent it over.
**Jon Kluger:** You should have.
**Jon Kluger:** I just moved the invite from this call to then, so it's easy for you.
**Jon Kluger:** We should be able to talk more then.
**Jon Kluger:** All right.

**Coach Jim:** You want 10 keywords, right?

**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll be more than happy to take a look at that and have that set up for you.

**Coach Jim:** All right.
**Coach Jim:** I made a note.
**Coach Jim:** We'll put that together for you.
