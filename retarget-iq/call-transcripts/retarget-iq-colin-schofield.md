## Transcript

**Jon Kluger:** One of my fraternity brothers is from Rio.
**Jon Kluger:** He's a hilarious guy.
**Jon Kluger:** Every time he would drink too much.
**Jon Kluger:** He would just go, I'm from Brazil, bro.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's all he would say.
**Jon Kluger:** Great guy.
**Jon Kluger:** But we ended up staying less than a mile from where he grew up.
**Jon Kluger:** And he gave me the rundown of basically what to do and what not to do.
**Jon Kluger:** His two pieces of advice were very simple.
**Jon Kluger:** He said, the hill goes like this, don't go up it because that goes to a Flobella.
**Jon Kluger:** And he said, if there's a really hot chick talking to you and she.
**Jon Kluger:** Tries to get you to leave the club, you are not that hot, buddy.
**Jon Kluger:** She is not trying to have you.
**Jon Kluger:** Go home with her.
**Jon Kluger:** She is trying to set you up.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was like, okay, that's great advice, thanks.
**Jon Kluger:** My ego's a little hurt, but I appreciate the honesty.

**Colin Schofield:** Yeah, that's I guess, similar here.
**Colin Schofield:** Not into you, trying to set you up.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** It's better to be safe than sorry in those moments.
**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, Colin, I had a chance to take a look at your website.
**Jon Kluger:** I imagine I've got a decent understanding of what you guys do.
**Jon Kluger:** So I assume you're looking for intent data as it relates to the real estate industry.
**Jon Kluger:** Would that be correct?

**Colin Schofield:** Yes.

**Jon Kluger:** Wonderful.
**Jon Kluger:** Now are you looking to white label?
**Jon Kluger:** Are you looking to just pass lead lists from my understanding?

**Colin Schofield:** So we do cold email.
**Colin Schofield:** We right now get data from batch data.
**Colin Schofield:** They're really good for very like property specific type stuff and they have really good email data.
**Colin Schofield:** So we can filter by last sale date, estimated value of the properties, whatever.
**Colin Schofield:** Your 10 data would be great.
**Colin Schofield:** We just have bad experiences with it.
**Colin Schofield:** We just like have found that like, I don't know and I maybe love some insight here that like, it's just tough to get.
**Colin Schofield:** We, we've done the whole audience lab thing which I'm sure you've heard about and like they were fine, but I guess there wasn't really clear indication that like the intent data was legit, that it worked.
**Colin Schofield:** And I know everything is different, but yeah, looking at people that are trying to sell their home, I appreciate, I.

**Jon Kluger:** Appreciate the, the context there.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll give you a quick rundown of a little bit of what makes us different as well as why we will be useful for you so transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** V2 of our platform comes out February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** That will include built in email validation as well.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now we don't have built in email validation transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll be live in less than a little over two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** What we currently are doing is we're offering any of our partners that sign up during V1 that they will be grandfathered in at V1 prices for V2.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's just one thing to take into now.
**Jon Kluger:** Our data.
**Jon Kluger:** What makes our data special?
**Jon Kluger:** We are less than five people in.
**Jon Kluger:** The world to have our data contract.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that is I can tell you audience, Lab, Zoom Info, Apollo, all of those do not have access to what we have access to.
**Jon Kluger:** It is a publicly traded data company.
**Jon Kluger:** The whole reason that we have our access is our technical co founder spent the last 20 years working directly with them and Fortune 100 companies to leverage their data.
**Jon Kluger:** Because of that, he was able to garner a contract with them to allow us to essentially sell that data.
**Jon Kluger:** Normally, access to this data would cost you at least a quarter of a million dollars a month to start.
**Jon Kluger:** So we have a leg up because we have this lucky and relationship with that.
**Jon Kluger:** We take this core data set and.
**Jon Kluger:** We additionally waterfall enrichment 200 additional data sources to expand on intent capabilities as well as fill in any gaps.
**Jon Kluger:** Now where I see opportunity right off the bat, there's a couple things here.
**Jon Kluger:** There's a couple things in V2 that.
**Jon Kluger:** Are going to be very powerful for you that I can talk a little bit about.
**Jon Kluger:** One of the things we're still working pricing out, but it's going to get you very excited.
**Jon Kluger:** First and foremost, we have the ability we include super pixels.
**Jon Kluger:** So you have five super pixels per license.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can capture website visitors as they land on different websites.
**Jon Kluger:** So if your clients have property listings that are under their domain, you can place our super pixels directly onto their main domain and it will pan out to their subdomains and you can actually identify who is theoretically looking at each listing.
**Jon Kluger:** So we can actually look at their pathing, their source and actually their contact information, be it direct mail or email.
**Jon Kluger:** So we have triggers built in.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you want to say someone lands on a listing, they get a direct mail direct to that house, you can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** What we can also do is we can just capture that information and pass it through.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason that I think would be pretty powerful for you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** Are you setting up CRMs?
**Jon Kluger:** Are you using CRMs for each of these clients and you're passing over the data or are you just sending over the finalized list to them?

**Colin Schofield:** For my reference, we actually do the cold email as a service.
**Colin Schofield:** We white label smart lead, we load up smartly campaigns, we run a cold email.
**Colin Schofield:** They have a portal view that they view the responses in.
**Colin Schofield:** Perfect.

**Jon Kluger:** So what we would, what we could.
**Jon Kluger:** Do with you is white label our platform so you can create individual instances for each of your clients.
**Jon Kluger:** They can even come in and see the analytics behind their website visitors.
**Jon Kluger:** They can see the analytics behind where they're coming from in their geo.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll show you that exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** So you get a little bit of an understanding.
**Jon Kluger:** So this is what our homepage looks like.
**Jon Kluger:** This is what the Super Pixel essentially allows for us to capture.
**Jon Kluger:** Up here would be additional dropdowns per website if they had multiple websites.
**Jon Kluger:** We're able to capture 40 to 70% website traffic visitors simply depending on cookie, cookie access.
**Jon Kluger:** This is included regardless of the package you choose.
**Jon Kluger:** You can choose not to use it, you can choose to use it.
**Jon Kluger:** Totally up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** Why I like it for you specifically.
**Jon Kluger:** In the retail front, real estate front.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can actually look at a heat map on the website visiting traffic.
**Jon Kluger:** So I always say this is a really great visual tool for those who aren't necessarily visually data inclined.
**Jon Kluger:** So no offense to real estate agents.
**Jon Kluger:** Real estate agents.
**Jon Kluger:** Why it's nice is let's say you're looking at Dallas, for example.
**Jon Kluger:** You could actually figure out, all right, is my website traffic coming from Frisco, where there's a lot of rich people, Is it coming from Arlington, which is also very wealthy, or is it coming from Dallas downtown, where it might not be as high income?
**Jon Kluger:** You can see the top cities, the top sources, the top pages.
**Jon Kluger:** If we look at the analytics, this is going to be a lot sexier.
**Jon Kluger:** We're going to add a lot more to this in v2 on February 15th, but you can see the breakdown as well.
**Jon Kluger:** Now diving into what the visitor identification discloses to you.
**Jon Kluger:** As I mentioned, we'll capture their name, their email, their mailing address.
**Jon Kluger:** This is even if they didn't put in contact information on the website.
**Jon Kluger:** We scroll over.
**Jon Kluger:** It's actually quite extensive.
**Jon Kluger:** Here's what you'll get excited about right off the bat.
**Jon Kluger:** What we'll be able to capture is.
**Jon Kluger:** Their identification, their location, their credit, their net worth, their income.
**Jon Kluger:** Are they a homeowner?
**Jon Kluger:** If they are a homeowner, what property do they own?
**Jon Kluger:** So we can actually just pull that for each and every person.
**Jon Kluger:** The beautiful part about this is we can, when we do our intent data, filter it based off of homeowner and homeowner.
**Jon Kluger:** So we can actually get pretty granular.
**Jon Kluger:** The other thing to highlight is I know you said you mentioned working with audience lab.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't have an audience cap, we don't have a lead cap.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't have.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't believe in it because we believe.
**Jon Kluger:** I, I come from a data analytics background.
**Jon Kluger:** I went to school for it.
**Jon Kluger:** I've been working with the top AI companies across the world and the top data companies.
**Jon Kluger:** And every single person agrees.
**Jon Kluger:** You need to be curious.
**Jon Kluger:** To be successful with data, you need to be able to explore, you need to be able to test.
**Jon Kluger:** If we sit here and say, you have four audiences, pay me five grand.
**Jon Kluger:** That's all you get.
**Jon Kluger:** How are you supposed to improve your business?
**Jon Kluger:** You're doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.
**Jon Kluger:** That's literally the definition of insanity.
**Jon Kluger:** So we believe in letting you explore.
**Jon Kluger:** Test, try different filters, try different intent topics, do whatever you need to do to find the right match, and then we'll show you exactly how we do that.
**Jon Kluger:** You can leave it on basically an.
**Jon Kluger:** Update, auto update for the query, auto push, auto, everything.
**Jon Kluger:** So you find one intent list that works for one of your clients.
**Jon Kluger:** You never have to lift a finger again.
**Jon Kluger:** You just have to push it into your CRM and you're able to rock and roll.
**Jon Kluger:** Now you probably go, all right, that's all nice.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't believe you.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, well, this is a real account that we use for demo purposes.
**Jon Kluger:** If you can see, in a little.
**Jon Kluger:** Stretch of five hours, we pulled about 3.5 million contacts.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not going to count.
**Jon Kluger:** Now.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's build an audience.
**Jon Kluger:** You're familiar with audience building if you use Audience Lab.
**Jon Kluger:** What I'll just tell you a little.
**Jon Kluger:** Bit about us is advanced search is LinkedIn Boolean.
**Jon Kluger:** Think about it like that.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not looking for anything to do with intent.
**Jon Kluger:** If you connected to your CRM, we're essentially doing an API call to enrich.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to do that.
**Jon Kluger:** We would essentially just be pulling from this.
**Jon Kluger:** It wouldn't take every single intent topic that this person has shown up in and, and transfer it over to your CRM because then we would just bombard you with so much data, your system would shut down probably.
**Jon Kluger:** So we would just essentially fill in the gaps of any of the fields that you need in that moment.
**Jon Kluger:** And temp B2C is exactly as it sounds.
**Jon Kluger:** This is probably where you would be living most of the time.
**Jon Kluger:** Reason for that is it's just targeting the consumer.
**Jon Kluger:** B2B is how we could prospect into additional clients.
**Jon Kluger:** So someone's looking for cold email.
**Jon Kluger:** You could select cold email filter for the job title of real estate agent, and then this could essentially be a target list for you to expand your book of business.
**Jon Kluger:** We put in Audience Lab pushed it to our ad account and launched apps.

**Colin Schofield:** That's how you guys ended up on my Instagram.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you needed any testimony of it, it works.

**Colin Schofield:** Yeah, that's pretty cool.

**Jon Kluger:** Now let's go into an audience builder for you.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing I want to highlight that we do is we never recommend going beyond two weeks when we look at intent and we have that built into the platform.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is we are genuine.
**Jon Kluger:** We genuinely look at this as high level buying signals.
**Jon Kluger:** So when you see the results here, you're going to see low, medium and high.
**Jon Kluger:** Low, I always say is a B high, A medium.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me, is an A and high is an A plus.
**Jon Kluger:** If they're showing up with intent, they are waving a buying signal flag.
**Jon Kluger:** If we're going to highlight them for you, it is not a matter of.
**Jon Kluger:** This guy's kind of in.
**Jon Kluger:** We're very, very specific because we understand every dollar you spend on ads or every email you send.
**Jon Kluger:** On cold email outreach, it is important to make sure that they're actually the audience that you want to either protect your ad budget or protect your domain.
**Jon Kluger:** So we'll go ahead and select two.
**Jon Kluger:** Weeks for this instance and the topic.
**Jon Kluger:** Do you want to do selling or buying?

**Colin Schofield:** Selling.

**Jon Kluger:** Selling.
**Jon Kluger:** We have a specific location, state, any.
**Jon Kluger:** City, what have you.

**Colin Schofield:** Yeah, try Worcester, Massachusetts.

**Jon Kluger:** Rooster.

**Colin Schofield:** Worcester.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** My family's from Newton.

**Colin Schofield:** Oh, yeah, yeah, I know Newman.
**Colin Schofield:** I'm from Shrewsbury, so it's kind of near Newton.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** How old are you?
**Jon Kluger:** We might know people.

**Colin Schofield:** I'm 23.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, you're too young.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm 29.
**Jon Kluger:** I used to go to Camp Amesbury, Mass.
**Jon Kluger:** Sleepwalk in the summers.
**Jon Kluger:** And I know Amesbury.
**Jon Kluger:** So you know Andyman.

**Colin Schofield:** I don't know Andyman.

**Jon Kluger:** Andyman's the coffee shop there.
**Jon Kluger:** That's like goaded.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, I'm just going to do this.
**Jon Kluger:** Because I know better.
**Jon Kluger:** Did I spell it right?

**Colin Schofield:** Oh, no, it's W, O, R, S. Sorry, sorry.

**Jon Kluger:** C. There it is.
**Jon Kluger:** C, E, S. Yeah, I always misspelled it.
**Jon Kluger:** So I always double check because it's never how it sounds.

**Colin Schofield:** Perfect.
**Colin Schofield:** There we go.

**Jon Kluger:** Maya, you can use ice cream in Amesbury.

**Colin Schofield:** Oh, is that the Red Barn?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Colin Schofield:** Yep, yep.
**Colin Schofield:** I know because.
**Colin Schofield:** So my dad lives in new report.
**Colin Schofield:** So it's literally like essentially almost the same town.
**Colin Schofield:** It's like they're stacked on top of each other.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, that's.
**Jon Kluger:** That was where we used to.
**Jon Kluger:** If you were the best behaved bunk, you would get an ice cream party at Hodges.

**Colin Schofield:** Yeah, that's pretty funny.
**Colin Schofield:** I've been there.

**Jon Kluger:** And then additionally we'll do city and then we're going to of course select homeowner.
**Jon Kluger:** Yes, you gotta be a homeowner.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll say yes, there is probable.
**Jon Kluger:** I wouldn't recommend probable right now because.
**Jon Kluger:** Like it's a hit or miss in my opinion.
**Jon Kluger:** If we say yes here, you can be confident in the results.
**Jon Kluger:** And then we'll simply hit now you'll see it says 15 to 20 minutes.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a lie.
**Jon Kluger:** We simply had a guy that was the most impatient client ever and he'd be like, where's the results, where's the results?
**Jon Kluger:** Where's the results?
**Jon Kluger:** So I got so annoyed, I said.
**Jon Kluger:** Just put 15 to 20 minutes there.
**Jon Kluger:** And have him deal with it.
**Jon Kluger:** In reality, I always say check your phone, check your email, hit refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** So what you're going to see here is 722records in Worcester that show intent for home selling.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll see it as a low, medium or a high.
**Jon Kluger:** Confirmed that they all are homeowners.
**Jon Kluger:** We actually have their literal mailing address.
**Jon Kluger:** Their age, are they married?
**Jon Kluger:** Are they not?
**Jon Kluger:** And you can actually easily take this, I'll scroll over for you as well.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can see their net income.
**Jon Kluger:** At the top net worth income range, the company they work at, their demographics of the company as well.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you like this and.
**Jon Kluger:** You want to download it.
**Jon Kluger:** So we'll go here, remove the stuff.
**Jon Kluger:** We hit save.
**Jon Kluger:** Now you'll see this is going to be a saved query.
**Jon Kluger:** As a saved query, you could do a couple things.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me, you can wait for this.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll be able to download it manually.
**Jon Kluger:** No problem here.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll be able to schedule it.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you schedule it, that means.
**Jon Kluger:** You could have it rerun every single day, delivering fresh leads to your clients every single day with the same parameters.
**Jon Kluger:** You can schedule to send it to.
**Jon Kluger:** An ad account if you wanted to run ads or if you wanted to give them the option of, hey, we have this tool now, we can even use these to run ads for you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** You could easily have it as an added service now if you choose so.
**Jon Kluger:** Or alternatively you can simply export it as a CSV.
**Jon Kluger:** You will see the option to export.
**Jon Kluger:** To your integration, but since this is one of our clients, we promised them we wouldn't set up the integration and be pushing stuff into their HubSpot because.
**Jon Kluger:** They were like, all it takes is.
**Jon Kluger:** One person to accidentally click a button.
**Jon Kluger:** And now our HubSpot is bombarded.
**Jon Kluger:** But with that being said, these are.
**Jon Kluger:** Some of the connectors we already have in place in V2.
**Jon Kluger:** We will have a ton more if you don't see one that you need.
**Jon Kluger:** We have API documentation absolutely everywhere, so it's super easy for you to know how to use it.
**Jon Kluger:** I have numerous clients that have literally taken the link to this, dropped it in cloud code, told them they're set up and within an hour it's set up.
**Jon Kluger:** If you need a clean integration for any of your setups as well, and we decide to move forward on a white label partnership, I can have the tech team, I can talk to the tech team about building that out for you as well.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, now that's a little bit about us.
**Jon Kluger:** So as you'll see in the saved queries, Worcester home selling owner is here.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not scheduled.
**Jon Kluger:** If you ever wanted to go in.
**Jon Kluger:** And schedule it easily can do it.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to essentially do.
**Jon Kluger:** A head to head to head on one day and see which phrases, which in 10 categories, which groups are going to perform the best, you can easily put them head to head on your end, come back, say this one was the best.
**Jon Kluger:** I want to rock and roll with this, refresh it and use that in perpetuity.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, now here comes the fun part.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to see what the identification, what it looks like on the export.
**Jon Kluger:** So SHA256 we have over 90% match rate on so that's why our meta ads are super duper effective.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to say have an opportunity to test, maybe you say to one of your clients, hey, you're.
**Jon Kluger:** Really good with us.
**Jon Kluger:** Give me 50 bucks a day, give.
**Jon Kluger:** Me a couple of weeks, let me see what I can do for you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** That into meta you could easily open yourself up to an entirely new stream of revenue.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, going over, you'll see we've got business emails, mobile phones, LinkedIns.
**Jon Kluger:** The further we scroll, the more information we have.
**Jon Kluger:** You've got additional emails all the way over here where we have all the personal emails.
**Jon Kluger:** The intent category will be exported as well and you'll even have insight on when the account, the contact record was last updated.
**Jon Kluger:** Here comes the fun part that everyone.
**Jon Kluger:** Likes to talk about.
**Jon Kluger:** We have pretty pricing so we have two options.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to get get things.
**Jon Kluger:** Going, let's test things out, see how we're doing.
**Jon Kluger:** You can do this easily with a.
**Jon Kluger:** Single license, but what I don't recommend is if you wanted to have instances where your client can actually see a little bit more insight on the website, visitors, the analytics and all of that, we recommend a white label the reason for that is you can easily upsell it to clients, position yourself.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I say we can start.
**Jon Kluger:** With a single license is you can.
**Jon Kluger:** Start doing some data polls, distribute them, see how it performs.
**Jon Kluger:** If it performs well and you want to then essentially position, hey, I wanted to have a dedicated account for you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** It will cost you.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, that's 20 extra licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** We're essentially selling at the most expensive white label.
**Jon Kluger:** You get 10 licenses at the equivalent of $400 a license with the API included and five super pixels for each of those license.
**Jon Kluger:** That's the cheapest deal you're ever going to see from us, except if you go up in, in volume.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you have 20 clients and you need an extra 10 licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** You're looking at a $250 per license cost.
**Jon Kluger:** What that means to you is come February 15th, the pricing on our website.
**Jon Kluger:** Is going up $250 for each single license, regardless of the instance.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we include the API access for you.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you have 10 clients and you're white labeled with us, which will be branded to you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm sure you, you're familiar with white labeling.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll literally be able to sell a.
**Jon Kluger:** Piece of tech that that is advertised.
**Jon Kluger:** As $1,000 a month that you're only paying $250 a month for.
**Jon Kluger:** If that plus your services for a thousand bucks to each client.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to say, hey, I'm cutting you a good deal, it's only 800 bucks, you're more than welcome to do that.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't care.
**Jon Kluger:** We just ask you don't drop below 400 in your offering price because we want to make sure that you know you're not undercutting us directly.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, we can start you with a single license.
**Jon Kluger:** You can get locked in at that 500amonth.
**Jon Kluger:** Or with the API, it would be 749.
**Jon Kluger:** You're grandfathered in.
**Jon Kluger:** I will, I will respect the white label pricing here too.
**Jon Kluger:** So if in a month you say, Jonathan, my clients love the results.
**Jon Kluger:** I want to white label this so I can have different profiles, different setups.
**Jon Kluger:** As our V2 gets ramped, it's going to be so many additional features.
**Jon Kluger:** I want to switch over to white label.
**Jon Kluger:** I will respect whatever pricing you've seen today.
**Jon Kluger:** If we talk in a week, that's when our price increases go.
**Jon Kluger:** I would have to.
**Jon Kluger:** Technically, it's February 7th is our price increase.
**Jon Kluger:** If we were to talk February 7th, all of these prices would be increased.
**Jon Kluger:** So if I can lock you in before then, what we're looking at today will always be the kind of conversation we have.
**Jon Kluger:** I won't.
**Jon Kluger:** You won't see me throw it all.
**Jon Kluger:** The way up there or yada yada yada.
**Jon Kluger:** Additionally, something to mention.
**Jon Kluger:** If you don't need an instance where your clients come into play on V2.
**Jon Kluger:** We will have the ability for you to set up multiple integrations to CRMs.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now, we only have the ability to plug into one.
**Jon Kluger:** What that means is for each additional CRM instance or account you want to plug into, It'll be about $75 a month extra.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you decide, hey, I don't want to do white label because none of my clients access this, it's all.
**Jon Kluger:** Done for you approach, then we'll just.
**Jon Kluger:** Say add an additional number of integrations that you need and you can have a more efficient pricing model that way as well.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm all about fighting for what makes the most sense.
**Jon Kluger:** My logic, my, my opinion is this, Colin, I don't believe in overselling to you and having you get annoyed and not happy with the results that you have.
**Jon Kluger:** I'd rather describe something that makes sense for you and we can grow together to then get you to a point where it makes sense for you and your business to either add additional integrations or add additional licenses, whatever that might be.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm here to be a partner.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not here to sell you something, run away and then say, sorry, buddy, that's not how I rock and roll.

**Colin Schofield:** All right, so again, right now what we do is we do cold email as a service and it's great.
**Colin Schofield:** We're not pulling intent data, we're just pulling property data based on, you know, last sale date and estimated value of the properties.
**Colin Schofield:** And that works.
**Colin Schofield:** Works well.
**Colin Schofield:** So if intent data works, that's great.
**Colin Schofield:** It seems like we would still need to pull emails, which is fine.
**Colin Schofield:** Like we would maybe enrich what we get from you guys with the batch data for email specifically and that'd be kind of the workflow.
**Colin Schofield:** The, the one big question mark as you think about is, well, like if we did use this, I'd want to really use it.
**Colin Schofield:** My first thought is we would use it as like a, is like a downsell and if it really works, we could just use it as part of the service.
**Colin Schofield:** We can also use it as a front end, just lower ticket offer to then send them into cold email just full on with us.
**Colin Schofield:** Like there's a few ways.
**Colin Schofield:** Again, with Audience Lab, it was kind of like, we got all excited and then we're like, the data, like we were texting, calling.
**Colin Schofield:** I had two of my real estate agent friends cold calling.
**Colin Schofield:** We were emailing as well.
**Colin Schofield:** And it was just kind of like, so do you, can you give samples?

**Jon Kluger:** I can't give samples.
**Jon Kluger:** No, we're not, we're not legally allowed to.
**Jon Kluger:** Our data provider won't let us.
**Jon Kluger:** What I can say is we, we don't lock you in on a contract.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to do a.
**Jon Kluger:** Month at 750 to just test it.
**Jon Kluger:** You'Re more than welcome to.
**Jon Kluger:** We can set that up.
**Jon Kluger:** The whole thing is this, is, this quarterly is the best deal we'll ever do.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, if you do that, you pay fifteen hundred dollars for the entire quarter.
**Jon Kluger:** You have full access.
**Jon Kluger:** Or alternatively, we do have clarinet.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you want to split up payments month over month, this will give.
**Jon Kluger:** You full access to the tool.
**Jon Kluger:** The API is an additional cost.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll see if I can negotiate something more for you guys too.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll ask the CEO what I look at this as in terms of an opportunity.
**Jon Kluger:** So I have a client who is what you call it, he is a real estate agent and he has a roofing company.
**Jon Kluger:** He takes the address of every single person who's high intent.
**Jon Kluger:** He puts it into ChatGPT and he asks it for knocking pass.
**Jon Kluger:** Literally.
**Jon Kluger:** Then will pull up to the houses and say, for roofing especially you say, hey, I was in the neighborhood, I was driving by, I saw a few shingles missing off the top of your roof.
**Jon Kluger:** He's like, you know, while I'm here.
**Jon Kluger:** You want me to climb up there.
**Jon Kluger:** Do an appraisal, see what it would.
**Jon Kluger:** Look like for you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** And every single time someone goes, oh, I was just looking up roofers, it's.
**Jon Kluger:** So funny that you're here.
**Jon Kluger:** I'd love for you to be able.
**Jon Kluger:** To do that for me.
**Jon Kluger:** So like in the real estate or.
**Jon Kluger:** In the this environment, I think where intent can be so powerful for your clients is not just on cold email.
**Jon Kluger:** You could even pass over the high, the super high intent and tell them.
**Jon Kluger:** Go drive by that house.
**Jon Kluger:** Go knock on the door, ask them if they consider selling or if they're looking at selling their home.
**Jon Kluger:** If the person goes, yes, there's your new client.

**Colin Schofield:** Pretty interesting.

**Jon Kluger:** And then also mention this.
**Jon Kluger:** We have direct mail too.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to create a trigger where direct mail would send directly from website visitor interactions or certain thresholds, or just upload a CSV of all the people that have shown high intent, you can Easily do that.
**Jon Kluger:** You can choose the front, the back, the name, what the mail type is, who you want to send it to and it's about $0.90% postage included.
**Jon Kluger:** If you already have a mail sender, totally cool.
**Jon Kluger:** Just export the list as a CSV and bring it over there.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not going to be a heartbroken.

**Colin Schofield:** Okay.
**Colin Schofield:** This is pretty cool.
**Colin Schofield:** I model about testing data.

**Jon Kluger:** I.

**Colin Schofield:** Just adding a lot of stuff right now.
**Colin Schofield:** I just had a new fractional cto he's doing a lot of stuff.
**Colin Schofield:** I'm gonna literally talk new here in.

**Jon Kluger:** A second actually 11.

**Colin Schofield:** So you know I need to be careful.
**Colin Schofield:** I wouldn't call this a shiny object but that is what we've you know definitely happened with Audience Lab.
**Colin Schofield:** It's a good shiny object.

**Jon Kluger:** People from Audience Lab every single day.

**Colin Schofield:** I love it.
**Colin Schofield:** Okay.
**Colin Schofield:** Okay.
**Colin Schofield:** I mean.

**Jon Kluger:** After February 6th it goes up.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you need to take the weekend and hit me up on Monday.
**Jon Kluger:** And tell me what's up sounds good.
**Jon Kluger:** Like I'm, I'm, I'm just your.
**Jon Kluger:** Your easy point of contact.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what I view myself as my we're a team.

**Jon Kluger:** You choose to move forward.
**Jon Kluger:** We're a team.

**Colin Schofield:** Yeah.
**Colin Schofield:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Colin Schofield:** Why don't we talk down to talk like Monday and I'll put it on my notes like figure this out because I would be down to just even just pull it for like myself or like some of our better clients and just say hey try this your campaigns like whatever it is a hundred percent.

**Jon Kluger:** And I would even recommend to you I don't know how much research or experience you have with Andromeda AI Meta's.
**Jon Kluger:** New AI that they have at targeting but like a simple creative plus high intent target list.
**Jon Kluger:** We're cutting the costs of people's campaigns.
**Jon Kluger:** In half and doubling the conversion rates.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Colin Schofield:** That's awesome.
**Colin Schofield:** I would love to figure this out with like a cold email play where like the workflow is recharged IQ enrich.

**Jon Kluger:** With batch data email.

**Colin Schofield:** I'm like here.
**Colin Schofield:** That's what we're working.
**Colin Schofield:** We are working on that right now as we speak and it's on our See our new fractional ctos list is like once we knock out all the more important stuff right now we're looking at other data providers share that with the only as one yeah.
**Colin Schofield:** I'm gonna share these notes with them.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh I Got you.
**Jon Kluger:** It's the API for us.
**Jon Kluger:** So he can take a look at that to see.
**Jon Kluger:** Literally, if you wanted to have just.
**Jon Kluger:** An API call to our system to.
**Jon Kluger:** Auto enrich the existing data that you.
**Jon Kluger:** Have, we can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** You can make API calls just to pull things over and you could easily set triggers that if we push over an intent list and it's already someone that you have, transfer the intent label over to that contact within the system where you know it's from your initial list that you got, plus the intent data.
**Jon Kluger:** And what you can even do, which some of my other clients do, is as these batches come in, where they.
**Jon Kluger:** Update it every single day, they'll keep.
**Jon Kluger:** Track of when the intent started and when the intent ends, if someone stops showing intent.
**Jon Kluger:** And then you can actually use that on your end for analytics to look at.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** If this person has shown.
**Jon Kluger:** We caught them having intent, we waited, we waited, we waited.
**Jon Kluger:** They were low intent, let's say.
**Jon Kluger:** And then all of a sudden they dropped off.
**Jon Kluger:** We found out they bought.
**Jon Kluger:** We know we still need to reach out to those four.
**Jon Kluger:** We learned that if you don't hit a high intent person within 24 hours on a call and an email, you're not going to capture them, whatever that might be.
**Jon Kluger:** You can start tracking that and leveraging that and actually create best practices on your end from just the data insights, the intent patterns.

**Colin Schofield:** Yeah, I mean, this would be freaking awesome.
**Colin Schofield:** I.
**Colin Schofield:** You definitely gave me, definitely gave me a lot of good information.
**Colin Schofield:** Let me.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm a data guy who likes to create an invent.
**Jon Kluger:** So I have a few of my own businesses that I, I do on the side.
**Jon Kluger:** So when, when we talk through things, I'll throw you things and if it sticks and it's something that you like, use it.

**Colin Schofield:** My.

**Jon Kluger:** Use it, my friend.

**Jon Kluger:** I see pattern recognition everywhere, so I'm easy.
**Jon Kluger:** Just chat through it with me.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm happy to have a convo, take the idea and run with it.
**Jon Kluger:** Just when I come down to Columbia, show me a good time.

**Jon Kluger:** Just if you text me, my only ask is, is say who you are.
**Jon Kluger:** So I have a little context because people would like to text me random questions and not tell me who they are.
**Jon Kluger:** And then I'm very confused.

**Colin Schofield:** All right, I'm just gonna switch my name.

**Jon Kluger:** Beautiful.
**Jon Kluger:** That's me.

**Colin Schofield:** All right, I'm gonna have these peptide guys, by the way, hit you up.

**Jon Kluger:** The other guys who are now actively running ads, you know, lying about us.
**Jon Kluger:** So they say that if you want a good laugh, take a look at the video.
**Jon Kluger:** It goes when they're renting data from you, but it's terrible data and they charge less.
**Jon Kluger:** And me and my co founders were.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, so we charge less for your data and you're.
**Jon Kluger:** And it sucks.
**Jon Kluger:** Wouldn't that be three different reasons not.
**Jon Kluger:** To work with Audience Lab?
**Jon Kluger:** Your data sucks.
**Jon Kluger:** We're cheaper.
**Jon Kluger:** Like.
**Jon Kluger:** Just think it's hilarious, right?

**Colin Schofield:** I thought that literally two days ago.
**Colin Schofield:** I was like, that doesn't really make sense.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, this guy.
**Jon Kluger:** Literally, we had to block their CEO.
**Jon Kluger:** On social media because he was going.
**Jon Kluger:** And putting paragraphs this long on our.
**Jon Kluger:** Ads that were just false information.
**Jon Kluger:** And we were debating about sending a.
**Jon Kluger:** Cease and desist, but I went, this is hilarious.
**Jon Kluger:** I love seeing him just lose his mind.

**Colin Schofield:** Good publicity, right?
**Colin Schofield:** Any publicity is good publicity.

**Jon Kluger:** It's.
**Jon Kluger:** He's advertising for us now.
