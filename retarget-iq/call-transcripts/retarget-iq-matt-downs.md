## Transcript

**Matt Downs:** Hey, Alex.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Hey, Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** How are you doing?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Well, how are you?
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm trying to stay warm, brother.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Where are you calling from?

**Matt Downs:** In North Carolina.

**Alex Ciereszko:** There you go.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Actually one of my, one of my colleague reps is also down in North Carolina.
**Alex Ciereszko:** He's in the Charlotte.

**Matt Downs:** Okay.
**Matt Downs:** Yep.
**Matt Downs:** Yeah, we're a bit there.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Not much an hour.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I believe you're, you're, you guys are doing something with windows.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Am I correct on that?

**Matt Downs:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, we do windows and doors.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, Matt, walk me through that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I always like to get a little background on the, on the business and then kind of cater, you know, our.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Tool around what you guys could utilize for sure.

**Matt Downs:** Yeah, we're family owned business.
**Matt Downs:** The only two things we do is window replacement and door replacement.
**Matt Downs:** So we focus that.
**Matt Downs:** Serve 2 Pretty good sized markets.
**Matt Downs:** Raleigh, Durham on one side of us and then we got Triad on the other which is Greensboro, Winston Salem area.
**Matt Downs:** So we got decent amount of population in our service area.
**Matt Downs:** Just really looking, looking to grow, looking to, you know, look for any advantage that we can get as far as, you know, finding people in, in market or you know, matching up good demographic psychographic profiles with, you know, what we're doing.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Absolutely.

**Matt Downs:** Like to be efficient about our ad spend and anyway, kind of stumbled on you guys and I had a, I did have a call with audience.
**Matt Downs:** Who's that?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Audience lab.

**Matt Downs:** Yeah, it was last, last year and they love us.
**Matt Downs:** Yeah, I just didn't really.
**Matt Downs:** He couldn't answer a lot of questions, you know.
**Matt Downs:** And anyway, it seemed like they were geared more towards agencies.
**Matt Downs:** Really.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.

**Matt Downs:** At the end of the day so.
**Matt Downs:** But I was, I was pretty intrigued by it, so.
**Matt Downs:** But didn't, didn't move forward of course.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And, and Matt, you know, just you know, our competition and other people out there in this market, I think a.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Lot of them focus more on the.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Agency, make money online Team reseller.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, right now we source our data from the Same places Fortune 100 and 500 companies are sourcing it from.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Those have been really hard to acquire.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Those licenses and we, we have good.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Results because of it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, we want the end user, AKA somebody like yourself to utilize this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And you know, we have agencies that resell it as well, but it's just.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Not our main focus at all.
**Alex Ciereszko:** When you had looked into this previously.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Are you guys currently running any advertising.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Any cold email, anything like that?

**Matt Downs:** Yeah, we're not doing any cold email right now.
**Matt Downs:** So you know that we actually I had a, had an agency that, well, they're a big organization.
**Matt Downs:** They're actually owned by USA Today, the Gannet.

**Alex Ciereszko:** No way.

**Matt Downs:** But they did, they did some.
**Matt Downs:** I did a three month kind of cold email campaign with them last year, but other than that, we don't do anything ourselves, so.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, got it.

**Matt Downs:** And then we've done a little bit of like cold dialing, but not much.
**Matt Downs:** We're not, we don't have a huge team that just as a kind of a filler, you know, when things are slow type of thing.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And any sort of Facebook or Google Ads or none at all.

**Matt Downs:** I don't have Facebook on right now.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Matt Downs:** Definitely want to.
**Matt Downs:** We'll be doing that for sure.
**Matt Downs:** And then we run Google.
**Matt Downs:** Right.
**Matt Downs:** Wonderful.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Matt, before we jump in, the two most effective ways that I always tell people to utilize data like this because.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you don't utilize it, it doesn't make.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The best two ways you're going to be able to do that is running.
**Alex Ciereszko:** These lists to your Google and your meta accounts.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, I have a video on.
**Alex Ciereszko:** My, on my, on my desktop here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you see this testimonial video with our client Greg Rider, this video, I literally pulled this the other day.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And if you go over here, I'm going to show.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can still see my screen, correct?

**Matt Downs:** Yeah, it's a little divvied up.
**Matt Downs:** We got.
**Matt Downs:** Let me change my, my view.
**Matt Downs:** Okay.
**Matt Downs:** Get rid of our.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, okay, perfect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you, if you see, if you see where my mouse is here, there's going to be.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And it might be a little bit blurry on your end, but there's two different numbers.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There's one for a dollar 75 and.
**Alex Ciereszko:** One for a dollar and one cent.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So both of these campaigns, this original campaign was being run without our audiences.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The dollar campaign has been being run with our audiences.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So almost, you know, a cost reduction in half.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And if you actually go over and.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Look at their click through rates as.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Well, where is that click through rate?
**Alex Ciereszko:** There we go.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's the original $6, 6.94%.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then using our intent data, they jump to, you know, a 12.5% pretty much.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So again, two of the most effective ways to utilize this cold email and advertising, whether that's your Google Ads, we.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Do directly connect into Google Ads, we do also directly connect into meta to make it very easy for your ads.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Team to be able to utilize that data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And before I tell you more about the features, Matt, just so you know.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All of this data is unlimited.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can pull unlimited lists, you can.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Get unlimited website and landing page visitors that are identified through us we have a pixel that identifies anonymous visitors that then you can also remarket to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And we also have unlimited data enrichment.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's say over the years you guys have built up a list of a bunch of people and you're like, you know what?
**Alex Ciereszko:** I want these people's mobile numbers.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I only have their emails.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can send that over to us.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We can enrich that data for you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And get all their mobile numbers as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's all unlimited.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There's no catches to this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We don't upcharge people on anything.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It is simply all unlimited data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's, that's.

**Matt Downs:** I mean, let me ask you this.
**Matt Downs:** I just, we just had a pretty good direct mail piece just went out.
**Matt Downs:** It was to a very targeted Persona.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.

**Matt Downs:** It was like 25,000 people.
**Matt Downs:** So I could take that and upload it and you could give me phone and email.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And we can actually do your direct mail directly from our back end right here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you ever wanted to mail through us, we have two different pricing models.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The 4 by 6 is 90 cents, all A through Z.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Done.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then the 6 by 9 is.
**Alex Ciereszko:** A dollar and 10 cents.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'm not sure what you guys are currently paying, but that's our pricing on the 4x6 and the 6 by 9.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And you can give us your list.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We can enrich all of that data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can use your current mail provider.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You could use us if you'd like, but we can certainly source that data for you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes, sir.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Everything you see here, Matt, is exactly what you guys would be getting.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So just to break it down, this is actually a live account.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is a capital funding company.
**Alex Ciereszko:** These are all the users they've had over the past week to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** These are all the users we've identified.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Again, completely unlimited.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you have one person or you have 1 billion people, it's totally unlimited.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We don't charge price per record.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you go over to visit Identification.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You'Re going to see all of those.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Visitors with their emails, their addresses, their mobile numbers, where they've been on your site.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And you can actually also on the see more tab here, you can click on these and see approximate credit ranges.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Income, home values and net worth.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Now I'd never bet, you know, my life on these numbers, but they're very.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Close to being accurate.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And in those ranges.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, okay.

**Matt Downs:** What, what percentage of like for a B2C company like us, what percentage of visitors are captured?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, so.

**Matt Downs:** And all that stuff, of course I.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Generally tell people anywhere from about 40 to 50% for this company overall, this whole week has been almost a 49% identification.
**Alex Ciereszko:** These guys actually started in September.
**Alex Ciereszko:** With us, it was like the end of September.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let's just go to the 30th of September.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So from September 30th of last year.
**Alex Ciereszko:** To this year, it's about to run these analytics here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It'll show you exactly across all this time what the numbers are looking like.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And this was a 45% identification rate.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right there, as you can see.

**Matt Downs:** So they sell to consumers, though?

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's correct, yes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So these guys are going in and they're pulling this data into their advertising campaigns and they're adapting advertising out.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They're not doing business, they're doing personal funding.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So same situation happening on your end.
**Alex Ciereszko:** About 40 to 50% identification.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we got that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The next thing I think you, you guys would love to do and what I would always recommend is the unlimited.
**Alex Ciereszko:** B2C B2B and also static list that you guys can pull.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So, Matt, you might have to help.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Me a little bit here with a keyword.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're gonna go two weeks back in time and I'm going to put in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Windows just to kind of show you what we got.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We have window repair, Pella Windows, Windows Mobile, window cleaning.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Help me out here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** What do you think would be a good keyword for you guys?

**Matt Downs:** Probably the one you're on right now.

**Alex Ciereszko:** No.

**Matt Downs:** Yeah.
**Matt Downs:** Window and door replacement.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Window door replacement.

**Matt Downs:** Be the prime.
**Matt Downs:** Prime one.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Perfect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just so you know, Matt, on February 15th we are releasing our V2 platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's going to be completely upgraded.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The price will go up a little bit.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right now we're holding our pric grandfathering people in, but it is going to allow you to do a bunch of.
**Alex Ciereszko:** More stuff as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And you're also going to be able.
**Alex Ciereszko:** To search by terms.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So for example, best windows and door replacement near me, that's going to be something you can search and you can.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Actually in your local area.
**Alex Ciereszko:** See, everybody's that everybody that's been searching it and then run advertising, call them cold, email them and do all that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So just so just so you know, on the, on the terms there, I'm.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Going to create a few rules here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let's make sure that we have their email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'm going to go ahead and.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Say email has value.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I also want their mobile number.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'm going to make sure that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That has a value.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Is there a specific city I could put in for you, Matt, that you guys operate or do you kind of do all in North Carolina.

**Matt Downs:** No, we don't do the whole state.
**Matt Downs:** Okay.
**Matt Downs:** Put in like Greensboro would be a good one.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Did I spell that correctly?

**Matt Downs:** No, it's just O at the end.

**Alex Ciereszko:** B, O, R. Oh, there we go.

**Matt Downs:** Awesome.

**Alex Ciereszko:** And is there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let's do one more field.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm going to make sure that all these people are also homeowners.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'll do yes and probable homeowner.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can obviously just use yes if you'd like to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I like using probable homeowner because most of the time, 80 to 90% of.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The time, they are actually a homeowner.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'll go ahead and run this list.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's going to say 15 to 20 minutes, but it is going to be pretty much ready.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And in the past two weeks, it looks like there's been about 2,000 people who have had some sort of intent.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Here on windows and doors replacement.

**Matt Downs:** Okay, so what's the low and medium?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, low and medium isn't going to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Necessarily be a intent score.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's going to be more so the.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Quality of the intent.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That meaning, for example, let's say we take Corinne confidence.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It kind of.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Kind of.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think this will.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This will explain it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So somebody like Corinne, for example, Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Maybe they went to, you know, Jimmy's.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Down street window replacement company.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They go to their website.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That website does not get a lot of traffic.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It is not very intentful.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Google knows it's not really converting people.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Maybe on the other hand, Janice goes to your website, okay, who had that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Has a lot more traffic and is a lot more popular and a lot more searched.
**Alex Ciereszko:** She's going to appear as a medium.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Or a high, for example.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So it's really scoring on where these people are going.
**Alex Ciereszko:** What we're going to be eventually doing is actually doing a score category of 0 to 100, showing how intentful those people are on a 0 to 100 scale.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But unlike other companies in our competition, every single one of these people have.
**Alex Ciereszko:** To display at least three separate intent signals.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Meaning they maybe searched it on Google.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They looked at it on Facebook, they.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Looked at it on YouTube.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Other companies, they're going to go in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And say, hey, Janice went in and.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Watched the YouTube video on window and door replacement.
**Alex Ciereszko:** She's intentful.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're sending them the list.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's why a lot of times you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Might see, you know, only 2,000 records pop up and think, oh, well, you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Know, that's a little low.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But we're also making sure that these.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Lists are actually super intentful.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We did signify we want their Personal email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So every single person is going to have a personal email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** These are validated emails.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're going to be validating this even more.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Additionally here in the next two weeks we have a new tool that we're.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Going to be cleaning those emails with.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then we also have their mobile.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Number and then anything associated with them.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So their address, job titles, seniority levels.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This probably won't be as important to you, but you can certainly mark these.
**Alex Ciereszko:** As open statements, meaning, hey, I want.
**Alex Ciereszko:** To know what their business email is.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I want to know what their LinkedIn URL is, all on that rule side.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's say, Matt, if you want to download this, you click download on this, it's going to appear in your saved queries.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's just say, you know, Cali Solar Homeowner, this is just an example.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That'S been pulled earlier.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I can actually go into this list.
**Alex Ciereszko:** For example, and let's just say this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Is your list that you made.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I can go in, I can export this as a CV CSV.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I can schedule this to run once a week, once a day and keep.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Populating and filling that information.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I can send it to an advertising account, meaning Facebook or Google, and I can also schedule it to an ad account, meaning, hey, I want this data punched over there once a day or once a week or once a month.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So some cool features on that.

**Matt Downs:** So question on that.
**Matt Downs:** When you're, when you're scheduling, does it, does it drop people off that are out like you pulled two weeks, does it like when somebody hits 15 days, is it dropping them out of that audience and then adding the new ones?
**Matt Downs:** And that's correct, just kind of refreshes?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes sir, exactly correct.

**Matt Downs:** Then when you, if you use the send the ad ad account, it would, it would do the same.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's correct.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The exact same process just being sent.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Over to your advertising platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I got you over on the integrations, Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't want to like bog you down with too much information, but on the integrations, in case you guys do use any CRMs like Salesforce, your HubSpot, high level fresh Sales, Zoho, we connect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Into all of those.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We are going to be releasing a new list of integrations as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Adding to it, we do also have.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Slack, pipedrive, HubSpot, Beehive, mailchimp, all this stuff.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we do directly integrate with these so you can upload all of your.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Data into your platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And other than that, the only other feature is the unlimited data enrichment.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we can enrich whether that's One.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Record or a billion records.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's all included in your monthly price.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, gotcha.

**Matt Downs:** On your integrations, do you have like Zapier?

**Alex Ciereszko:** We do not, but you could utilize it through API.

**Matt Downs:** Okay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** And that is being planned on.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're actually going to be adding Zapier.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm hoping February 15th along with our version 2 launch.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Gotcha.

**Matt Downs:** And then do you have like.
**Matt Downs:** Yeah, I don't see it.
**Matt Downs:** So this is.
**Matt Downs:** It is what it is then.
**Matt Downs:** So like if I want into a Google Sheet, you don't have like a direct to Google?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Unfortunately not, but that will be.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That will be February 15th.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Going straight to Google Sheets.

**Matt Downs:** Yeah.
**Matt Downs:** Okay.
**Matt Downs:** All right.
**Matt Downs:** Do you guys have any kind of.
**Matt Downs:** So there's not a native, like email piece I would need to connect?
**Matt Downs:** There is another tool of some kind?

**Alex Ciereszko:** There isn't, Matt, but we are planning on also releasing that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We have a list of things we, we get a lot of feedback from people like yourself.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, like we have roofers who say, hey, I really want credit ranges.
**Alex Ciereszko:** In the intent data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're going to be releasing credit ranges.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So anytime people give us feedback, like yourself, hey, native, you know, built in cold email would be phenomenal.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We just talked about that this morning.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're going to be able to suffice that and do that for you guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So really right now it's been focused around the data, putting all those pieces together and that's why we're grandfathering people in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then V2 on February 15th is really going to be the user experience.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We all have a marketing background.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We all know how things should be.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Running to make it really effective for people and easy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And that's exactly our plan with our next version.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Matt Downs:** Cool.
**Matt Downs:** Yeah, it looks pretty easy to use.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Perfect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Would you like me to start an account for you?

**Matt Downs:** What are we, what are we looking at?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, two different price points, Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Very simple.
**Alex Ciereszko:** No commitments, no long term contracts.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Number one is 749.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's month to month.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Or you can purchase it quarterly, which.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Is $1500 and your price comes out.
**Alex Ciereszko:** To $500 a month.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Again, no contracts, no commitments to it, no hidden fees.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean, it's.
**Alex Ciereszko:** People ask me all the time, is it really unlimited?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Is it really?
**Alex Ciereszko:** It really is.

**Matt Downs:** Okay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So what, what.

**Matt Downs:** Obviously the, the audiences are going to be pretty small because I'm localized.
**Matt Downs:** Like, do you have customers like me?
**Matt Downs:** Because I'm, I'm gonna have, yeah, I don't know, 200 zip codes, let's say.
**Matt Downs:** Or I don't know if you can pull by county or whatever.
**Matt Downs:** But yeah, we do it by zip.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Code, city and state.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And you can upload a whole file of zip codes as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you can have a plethora of.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Zip codes in there too.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Matt Downs:** So I mean there's going to be some numbers there.
**Matt Downs:** I mean just based on what you showed me, one, one, one key phrase pulled 2,000.
**Matt Downs:** So but you know how like the, it's not like I'm pulling a national audience and running ads to it.
**Matt Downs:** It's gonna, it's gonna, might be a little more expensive.
**Matt Downs:** Do you have people that are kind of regional or small like me that are having success with that, that strategy?

**Alex Ciereszko:** We do.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So that company I showed you in that, our client Greg, he owns like a local gun shop, gun signup kind of company.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So he's running it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I want to say he's probably running.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like a quarter of the state of Arizona in terms of zip codes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And that's his results on the ads.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know those are live results.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Every single.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I can show you emails of people doing local kitchen remodeling and their click.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Through rates, their link clicks, everything's doubling besides the price of their leads.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I believe it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I've run this for my marketing company that I run on the side for med spas and GLPs and weight loss.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's phenomenal.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And those guys are all on the local level because you're taking all the people who are interested and then putting that in front of them and saying.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Hey, this is what you got, right?
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is us.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So yeah.

**Matt Downs:** Okay.
**Matt Downs:** All right.
**Matt Downs:** And I can.

**Alex Ciereszko:** There.

**Matt Downs:** It looked to be like there were some categories that were stretches and some that were kind of pretty tight.
**Matt Downs:** Like the keyword we picked.
**Matt Downs:** Would you like recommend building different like groupings of, to kind of expand your reach a little bit?
**Matt Downs:** Maybe?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I would go topic by topic.

**Matt Downs:** I saw some competitors like Pella is a big national brand.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Like you could group a bunch of.

**Matt Downs:** Different like brands together and make like.

**Alex Ciereszko:** A, like a branded thing.

**Matt Downs:** Have overlap in those audiences?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Probably, yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we, we, we currently have them topic by topic.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we just let you pull one topic and then run another one in separate lists.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But what I would recommend is just like you said, Pella.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think there was also storm repair.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like there's a lot of those keywords like that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I would take all of those, Matt and I would put all those lists into one audience on, on Google, on Meta.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because even if you have someone looking at Pella or any of these other things, they're still looking Generally in your.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Industry, you know, I still pull lists of people interested in Botox for weight.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Loss clinics because they're still kind of in that same field.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Works.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And it works, you know, so I think, I think that you should pull.
**Alex Ciereszko:** A few lists and then upload those.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think that's going to give you even better results, you know, and just get your name to the right people.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Matt Downs:** So I guess like if we wanted to run a. I'm just thinking out loud, like we're, we're putting together like a veterans giveaway type of thing.
**Matt Downs:** We're gonna give away like a free project.
**Matt Downs:** So I could pull a list based on military, like a veteran or military interest type of thing.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm actually going to tell you right now what kind of keywords we have for that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Veteran care, veterans charities, veteran mental health, military.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So people just in or interested in military.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm trying to think of what other.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Words would go under that.

**Matt Downs:** Okay.
**Matt Downs:** All I can explore.
**Matt Downs:** So.
**Matt Downs:** Okay.
**Matt Downs:** I was just kind of thinking out loud.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, no worries.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm here to help you, Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean that I love doing this stuff.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just kind of helping people walk them.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Through how they can utilize it.

**Matt Downs:** When you guys push that audience, is it just pushing like the email over.

**Alex Ciereszko:** To Facebook, the, the Shaw code.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So the, the SHA 256 code that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Every single person has, that's a unique identifier for, for meta that helps identify each user and on their platform it's going to have that code in that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** File or that automatic sense.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So it's going to know exactly which people to target.

**Matt Downs:** So that hit rate will be really high.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Very.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean even, like the, even like those results that I showed you with, with Greg's campaign.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Matt, uh, it's the same thing man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean it's literally in a day to two days you see a huge increase in your click through rate, huge drop in price.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There's been times where there was a.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Slight drop in price, but the intent.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And the click through rate, you know, I much rather have a higher click through rate and have people actually interested.
**Alex Ciereszko:** In my ads and maybe even pay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** A little bit more than reducing my.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Cost and having still junk data, you know.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, yeah.

**Matt Downs:** Is there a recommendation on like time frame?
**Matt Downs:** Like have you like for somebody in like our space?
**Matt Downs:** Like is two weeks a good one to roll with or would you make it shorter?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Longer?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I like one week and two weeks.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's really up to you guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think it's really project by project based.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, I think people in your industry aren't going to come around and.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Make a decision in a day.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So for that I want to expand my search to those two weeks because I know anybody on the first of the month, you know, is still going to be somewhat.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Probably thinking about it or interested in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It or maybe making a decision.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I feel like those home renovation style projects and anything under the sun with that takes a while to make, you know, a decision on for people.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I would be running with two week audiences for sure.

**Matt Downs:** Yeah.
**Matt Downs:** And then it'll like if they continually have.
**Matt Downs:** Are clicking around, they'll stay in that audience.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They're going to keep getting hit with it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I got you.

**Matt Downs:** So you.
**Matt Downs:** It's just the ones, the ones that kind of don't show those signals.
**Matt Downs:** They're.
**Matt Downs:** They're the ones that fall off the other.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Correct.

**Matt Downs:** On the last day.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Matt Downs:** Well, looks.
**Matt Downs:** Looks interesting.
**Matt Downs:** I've got a. I gotta get approval from our owner which I should be able to do.
**Matt Downs:** Okay.
**Matt Downs:** And I'm.
**Matt Downs:** I'm in the process of kind of hiring internal person.
**Matt Downs:** Yeah.
**Matt Downs:** That's part of the reason why we're not on right now.
**Matt Downs:** Used agencies before.
**Matt Downs:** So we're gonna take a lot of that in house and.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.

**Matt Downs:** So should have all that kind of ready in the next couple weeks and see what, see what we're looking at here.
**Matt Downs:** No free trial or anything like that.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Unfortunately now with data loss can't.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I'd love to but there's got to be a.
**Alex Ciereszko:** In our licensing agreements, there's got to be an exchange where basically by extension you guys are allowed to use our.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Data like through us basically.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So unfortunately not.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But it's cheap enough to where you know, even if you did a month.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I can almost guarantee you results.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I never guarantee stuff but I mean.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I get the emails, I get the videos, I get people coming on and.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Saying hey look, these doubled.
**Alex Ciereszko:** These double.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This doubled.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, it's just the science behind it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, Facebook and, and Google can only do so much with data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You have guardrails up on that with this, you know, you got really precise.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Data hitting the right people.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So just like all those people, you know, when you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** When you look at companies that are doing any sort of airlines, you know, you talk about going on a trip, all of a sudden you're getting American Airlines.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is the same technology that you're utilizing as them.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Matt Downs:** And then the, the pixel.
**Matt Downs:** The pixel.
**Matt Downs:** You can included five websites.
**Matt Downs:** I mean that you can push that audience to.
**Matt Downs:** I'm Assuming separately.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Exactly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Exactly correct.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you get five websites for signing up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you can put it on your main website, you can put it on your landing pages.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So now, you know, let's say you guys are spending $3,000 a month on.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Advertising and you're getting 100, say all.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Those other people that landed on your landing page but never filled information out.
**Alex Ciereszko:** 50% of that, which can be thousands.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You'Re now getting all their information and.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can put that directly into retargeting campaign.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And now, you know, Matt, that went.
**Alex Ciereszko:** To the landing page is now getting hit with another ad which your marketing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Guys can figure out how to do that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean that's probably some of the basics, but 100% you can do that.

**Matt Downs:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Matt Downs:** Are you looking at any other platforms beyond those two as far as being able to push the data to like.
**Matt Downs:** I don't know.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, any.

**Matt Downs:** Anything like next door?
**Matt Downs:** I know that's a niche one, but yeah, programmatic platforms, Connected tv, something like that.
**Matt Downs:** To where?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Put it right in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Unfortunately not at the moment, Matt, but.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Again, we're always open to recommendations.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you end up becoming a client.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And that's something you really want, we.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just see how hard it is to develop and we push it out.

**Matt Downs:** Yeah.
**Matt Downs:** Okay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's what we've done with, with our platform now, you know, we're just trying to see what people say because if we do everything that people say.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And the consumers want, then it creates a kick ass platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Excuse my language, but you know, it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Creates an awesome platform for everyone to enjoy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All right, that's all I got.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Sounds good, Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll send you an email after.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's going to have two loom videos.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's going to explain just in depth, kind of digging through some lists and pulling them.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then I'll attach a monthly and a quarterly payment link.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If at any time you want to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Take care of that, we'll see that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We'll shoot over logins directly to you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You'll be in in about 30 seconds.

**Matt Downs:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Matt Downs:** All right.
