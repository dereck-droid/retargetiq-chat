## Transcript

**rellz20 mixon:** Full.
**rellz20 mixon:** We pull data from.
**rellz20 mixon:** From Audience Lab right now.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay.

**rellz20 mixon:** So I. I saw your guys's ad and I was like, ah, just see what.
**rellz20 mixon:** See what they have.
**rellz20 mixon:** So, yeah, how it differs.
**rellz20 mixon:** Is it all the same source that is being pulled from and et cetera, et cetera?

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.
**Matthew Bryce:** So literally, I. I just started shadowing this week, so I'm going to give you all the knowledge that I possibly can.
**Matthew Bryce:** Like I said, I just texted Alex and.
**Matthew Bryce:** But either way, I'll give you any information that I can.
**Matthew Bryce:** Anything that I'm not 100% sure about.
**Matthew Bryce:** I will make sure that I get back to you or Alex will join and he can get even deeper into the weeds.
**Matthew Bryce:** So just to confirm, you're using Audience Lab now, you leverage them for a lot of intent data and you're not going directly through Audience Lab.
**Matthew Bryce:** It sounds like you might have a broker.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.

**rellz20 mixon:** So I talked with Audience Lab and then I just so happened through a mutual friend connected with this guy who uses Audience Labs intent data.
**rellz20 mixon:** So I grabbed intent data of solar and Internet from him.

**Matthew Bryce:** Solar and Internet from him.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All right.

**Matthew Bryce:** So from what I'm gathering here and what's really intriguing me about what Alex and Nate are building is.
**Matthew Bryce:** And there's Alex.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Daryl, I'm so sorry, man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You gave me 10 minutes, and I used every 10 minutes of it to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** To make sure that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That I talked to one of these prospects.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But Matt, he just started with us, so I know he's doing a great job and getting you introed in, but I'm here now.

**rellz20 mixon:** Hey, don't apologize, man.
**rellz20 mixon:** I was just telling Matthew I completely left my phone for like 45 minutes to an hour, skipped our complete meeting and felt so terrible.
**rellz20 mixon:** So don't.
**rellz20 mixon:** Don't apologize.

**Alex Ciereszko:** It's all.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's all good, man.

**rellz20 mixon:** All good.

**Alex Ciereszko:** We're here now.

**Matthew Bryce:** And Alex, I was actually just about to explain a little bit to Jerrel of what I've learned so far.
**Matthew Bryce:** So if you don't mind, I'll quickly touch that with him and I'll explain to you exactly what he has said to me and then I'll pass the baton over to you because he's the expert.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm learning from him.
**Matthew Bryce:** So, Jerrel, overall, we have an amazing partnership with one of the top data providers in the country.
**Matthew Bryce:** They provide data to the top Fortune 100 companies, and we're able to leverage that data and we take that and we waterfall it through 200 other data providers to make sure that we're able to fill in any gaps that this amazing data provider can't fill, which is very few and far between.
**Matthew Bryce:** But either way, Alex, now to you.
**Matthew Bryce:** So what Jerrel had said to me is he is currently using Audience Lab.
**Matthew Bryce:** He's getting it from.
**Matthew Bryce:** It seems like a broker or somebody that he knows.
**Matthew Bryce:** He's getting intent data.
**Matthew Bryce:** So he's leveraging their intent data.
**Matthew Bryce:** Um, and.
**Matthew Bryce:** And that's kind of where we left off.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I was just explaining to him that waterfall that I know about, and I really think that this, you know, retarget IQ can be a huge opportunity for him, especially going direct.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I have a feeling, you know, once we dive in a little deeper, you know, we're going to.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're going to.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're going to be able to show him some great benefits.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Jerrel, please tell me, how are you guys utilizing the data right now?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because there's a bunch of ways that you can.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And I'm just curious how.
**Alex Ciereszko:** What your current structure is on that and how we could fix it.

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah.
**rellz20 mixon:** So currently what we're doing right now is I'm.
**rellz20 mixon:** I am a recruiter slash manager, slash sales rep for a company called Interactive Energy Systems.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**rellz20 mixon:** What they use are basically like demand controllers to help keep the demand low on.
**rellz20 mixon:** On houses and help keep the electricity bill down.
**rellz20 mixon:** So we pull solar intent data.
**rellz20 mixon:** We also are working with AT&T fiber.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**rellz20 mixon:** So we pull Internet intent data.
**rellz20 mixon:** And so we have a little bit of a crew right here, right.
**rellz20 mixon:** Right now that we're working with.
**rellz20 mixon:** And so we're going to start this week actually teaching our guys how to co dot with it.
**rellz20 mixon:** But right now we are knocking doors.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**rellz20 mixon:** And so we were starting to run a little bit of ads with it, but I was like, you know what, let's dial it back.
**rellz20 mixon:** Let's put more money into the boots on the ground, if you will.
**rellz20 mixon:** And then we can start with the.
**rellz20 mixon:** Then we can go back into the ads.
**rellz20 mixon:** So right now we're using it for dialing.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh.

**rellz20 mixon:** Secondly, we'll be using it for dialing, but right now we're using it for door to door.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, so good news, Jarrell.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're actually going in on February 15th.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We have a new launch, which is our V2 plat that's going to include a bunch of platform updates.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But I think the one most specific to you is going to be specific search terms.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I believe you guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Are you guys using specific search terms, like, you know, best solar panels near me, like those kind of.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Best roofer near me, that kind of search term.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Or how are you guys doing?

**rellz20 mixon:** I think it's just fiber Internet.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**rellz20 mixon:** And I think we're just using solar and renewable energy.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't have fiber Internet.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I do have solar, so solar panels, solar racking.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Does that sound familiar?

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah, those do.
**rellz20 mixon:** But we're more so looking for like sometimes solar panels can be like your B2B might be looking for the best solar panels to, to do, whether 400 watts or 430.
**rellz20 mixon:** I think there have been up to five if I'm not mistaken.
**rellz20 mixon:** So I don't necessarily like, we don't sell solar.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.

**rellz20 mixon:** So I'm just looking for people who are interested in solar or in energy.
**rellz20 mixon:** Like they're looking for something to help offset their bill.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So this would be on the B2C side.

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So we can actually swap these between, you know, just normal static searches of job titles and things like that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then we also have the B2C and the B2B side.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if I did something like solar panels.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You mentioned one other keyword, Gerald.
**Alex Ciereszko:** What was that keyword you said?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Fiber, Internet, Solar.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then there was a third one you mentioned?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Energy.

**rellz20 mixon:** Renewable energy.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I don't have renewable energy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** These are energy energy kind of it.

**rellz20 mixon:** Because I mean it's kind of a clean and it's kind of a clean energy and green energy.
**rellz20 mixon:** And we do like people.
**rellz20 mixon:** Actually what might not be bad is people who have H Vacs.
**rellz20 mixon:** So air conditioners.
**rellz20 mixon:** That's.
**rellz20 mixon:** That's really where our business really takes off.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**rellz20 mixon:** Because it's the more H Vacs a customer has.
**rellz20 mixon:** Like out here in Arizona, somebody having six air conditioning units is very normal.

**Matthew Bryce:** Wow.

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah, it's very normal.
**rellz20 mixon:** So like that gives us a pretty high commission.
**rellz20 mixon:** The money.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**rellz20 mixon:** They have.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So Gerald, what we have currently, I mean obviously we can make this work.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm really excited for you to see the new platform as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're just trying to get people in on this so they see the power of it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because we are going to start doing specific search terms just like you mentioned.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We would terms like this work for you for now.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, let's just say like which of these H Vac terms would be best for you?

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah, I feel like.
**rellz20 mixon:** Maybe energy efficient H Vac upgrades because this box helps with energy efficiency.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Got it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And are you guys looking at just the Arizona area?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Are you looking elsewhere?

**rellz20 mixon:** We have Arizona, Georgia, north and South Carolina.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**rellz20 mixon:** And I always miss one.
**rellz20 mixon:** Never.
**rellz20 mixon:** Virginia.
**rellz20 mixon:** There it is.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Virginia.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There we go.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So Arizona is az.

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Georgia is ga. And then you said.

**rellz20 mixon:** Virginia and north and South Carolina, this SC right there.

**Alex Ciereszko:** SC and then.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And is going to be right here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then let's find va.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There we go.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Perfect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Are there any parameters that you'd like?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Maybe these people's mobile numbers, for example?

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah, so we usually, we usually want to find people that have at least like a 570 credit score and then we want them to be homeowners.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just so you know, Gerald, credit score is going to be released in V2, so it's going to show you exact credit ranges.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Unfortunately, I don't have that just right now we're working on developing that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We do have homeowner.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So what I like to do is do.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes, and also probable homeowner.

**rellz20 mixon:** Okay.
**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah.
**rellz20 mixon:** Then obviously we name.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yep.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That automatically comes in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.

**rellz20 mixon:** So then I think that's kind of it.
**rellz20 mixon:** I mean we don't, there's no way for us to get details detailed down to the very dollar that they're paying.
**rellz20 mixon:** But.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Right, so this is, this is the list we just pulled that has just over a quarter million records right there that's going to include their name, also their personal email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I indicated, hey, you know, email has value as well as mobile has value.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is going to be any associated phone numbers that these people may have along with their addresses.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then here it's generally going to give you some information on any sort of business that they're working in or job or anything like that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can obviously signify, hey, I need industry, I need the company domain, I need the LinkedIn URL.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you can always change that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We didn't signify that because we're really just looking for the emails, the mobile numbers and the addresses you can obviously, you know, signify, hey, I want to know any sort of department they're working in, business email, their LinkedIn, all of that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And that's a list of about a quarter million people right there.

**rellz20 mixon:** And how does this, Alex, how does this similar to Audience Lab?
**rellz20 mixon:** Is it the same source you guys are pulling from different sources?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, not, not to say anything, but compared to our competitors, Gerald, we're actually using much better sources.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we have, we're lucky enough where we have a license with a data broker that is providing data to hedge funds.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Pretty much everybody who's moving the markets right now in terms of finance, they're one of the most popular ones to be using.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They're also one of the most expensive and one of the most hard to actually be able to get a license from.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we like to say that our data is a Step ahead.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And one of the things we are going to be doing is additional email validation with our next release.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But I mean I can literally.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Gerald, I have a video here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't know if you run any sort of advertising, but if you'd like to watch this testimonial, this was literally from yesterday, which is why it's on my desktop.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'd be happy to show you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But basically these guys go through and there's two separate numbers here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Can you guys still see my screen?

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So this $75 per lead campaign that he was running originally was reduced to just a dollar with our intent data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If we go over and look at their click through rates as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you look at CTR, it went from a 7% to almost a 13% on this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if that helps you with how powerful the data is, it's there especially with, with advertising, especially with cold email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right now we're working on kind of breaking into that door knocking space as well, which I know you mentioned.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And hey, that's what we really want to do as well as those search terms.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But the data is there and that's why so many of the people from Audience Lab are coming over to us because we're a much more affordable option for them.

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah, what, what were your.
**rellz20 mixon:** And I'm sorry, I do so much throughout the days.
**rellz20 mixon:** What was your guys's price points again?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, so we have two different options.
**Alex Ciereszko:** One's going to be a month to month.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Absolutely no commitment, no contract, nothing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You pay, you got it for 30 days.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you want to keep renewing, go for it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's going to be 7 49amonth.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It gives you access to completely unlimited audiences.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So Gerald, you can sit here and pull the same list that I just pulled every second.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There is no cap.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, you can keep pulling.

**rellz20 mixon:** You guys don't have a cap on how much you can pull?

**Alex Ciereszko:** No sir.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's part of our selling point and that's why people love it is because we just don't restrict our users.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So essentially what you've come from with, with our competition, they're doing their thing on our February 15 launch.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're taking it to match those features and push it way further ahead.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So this unlimited data is always going to be here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can pull as many lists as you'd like.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You also have unlimited website visitor identification if you want to put this stuff on your landing pages.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We can identify 40 to 50% of all of your website visitors anonymously.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's another thing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Exactly correct.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You get Five of those included.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Any additional pixel after that is just 10 bucks.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you have, you know, let's say a main website and then four landing pages, you can run a pixel on each of those and gather all that data here and then remarket to those people, which is a phenomenal way to approach the data, but you get unlimited resolution.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So, so this is actually a live account, Gerald, just so you know, this United Capital Source, they're one of our clients, they do capital funding, they're nice enough to let us go in and play around with their account and actually show real results.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But if you look just over the past week, they've had almost 9,000 users and about 4,300 people identified.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's just shy of a 50% identification rate.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So this is anonymous.
**Alex Ciereszko:** These people are not opting into your site.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's literally just grabbing their data and compiling it into leads.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you get unlimited website visitor resolution.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't care if you have one person or a million people visit your website in a day.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're going to identify those.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You have unlimited audiences.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So all of these lists right here that we can pull, that's totally unlimited.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then you also have unlimited data enrichment.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's say, Gerald, you have, you know, a list from your company of a hundred thousand people that have emails or maybe they have a company name and just their first name and last name.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We can go in and enrich that data based on credit scores, based on interest, based on mobile numbers, personal emails and get that all cleaned up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's really popular for our real estate agents that, you know, maybe they're just running some advertising that are low friction saying hey, give us your first name, last name and an email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Then they come around to us and then they say, hey, enrich this list for their mobile numbers.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And whether you know it or not, now they have your mobile number which they can call on.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's, that's a really powerful tool.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Again, that's completely uncapped.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't care if you give me one record to enrich or a billion, we can do it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Currently that's just done over email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You shoot us an email with that list, we get it around to you within 24 to 48 hours.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But it is going to be built in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So just like you see all these integrations as well, we're able to integrate with your HubSpot, your high level, your meta, your Google Ads account, also Slack Beehive, you know, let that pipe drive.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All of these are quick question with.

**rellz20 mixon:** Slack because I Have a team?
**rellz20 mixon:** Would I be able to.
**rellz20 mixon:** Because some of them are in different parts of the states.
**rellz20 mixon:** Would I be able to divvy up their, their regions to them through Slack or how would that work?

**Alex Ciereszko:** What you could do is, is yeah you can because instead of running a list for all these different states, you would just run hey, these and these zip codes and then shoot it over into their specific channel.

**rellz20 mixon:** Gotcha.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's, that's an approach I would take.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And Gerald, we're really open.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Matt knows this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're super open to feedback, right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We have people that sign up, they send us a loom video and they're like, hey, it'd be really cool if you guys could do this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And within a week or two we try to release that update because we want to have a really kick ass platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we're always open to any, you know, comments or suggestions you guys have.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, one of our biggest has been hey, we want to use this for door knocking.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I want to be able to go in and search, you know, best roofer near me term and see all the people who search that and then door knock them.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And it works phenomenal.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So these are all things that we're going to be including.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But going back to the pricing, 749 is month to month, gives you access to all this totally unlimited.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Or if you want a little bit of a price reduction, you can pay quarterly, which is fifteen hundred dollars.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It makes your bill five hundred bucks for the month.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Same exact platform, same features, same amount of lists you can pull.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Unlimited.

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah.
**rellz20 mixon:** Do you guys.
**rellz20 mixon:** So as far as like numbers and all that, do you guys run that.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Database also against the DNC at the moment we don't.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Um, so these numbers are going to be validated coming up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They're going to be skip traced in our new platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I personally, Gerald, I don't recommend cold calling.
**Alex Ciereszko:** People have done it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But I come from a marketing background.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I know that when people go in even as leads, right?
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you dealt with leads before, you know, these people have opted in and have shown true interest in an advertisement and you go and call them and they say I've, I've never heard of you, I'm not interested.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And they get all upset, right?
**Alex Ciereszko:** So this is taking an intense signal where they haven't even opted in and now you're calling.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we're very careful.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, other companies will say hey, you can call these numbers and everything.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're working on doing that and making sure that things aren't on the dnc list for right now, I would probably recommend to not cold call, but we have people who are doing it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They see success with it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'm not going to stop you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's just a disclaimer.

**rellz20 mixon:** Will the dnc, will that.
**rellz20 mixon:** Will that be one of the features that is added on the February launch?

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's correct, yes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The only problem, Gerald, is our pricing is going to go from about 500 bucks a month at that point being grandfathered in before to 997amonth.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we will see a price hike with that just because the platform is going to be even more powerful even now, man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean, there's companies that buy the Same data for 25 grand a month, you know, So I know it's out there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We try to keep the cost as limited as possible, but for the end user.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But we will see a little bit of a price hike there on our V2 launch.

**rellz20 mixon:** So it sounds like.
**rellz20 mixon:** With the competitor.
**rellz20 mixon:** It just sounds like.
**rellz20 mixon:** Because I think they're charging 997 as well.
**rellz20 mixon:** The biggest difference, it sounds like, is you guys don't have a cap on how much you can pull.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's correct.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There's going to be no caps, in my opinion.
**Alex Ciereszko:** A much more robust and powerful platform across the board as well, and better data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That, that's, that's.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Those are the three points there, Gerald.

**rellz20 mixon:** Okay.
**rellz20 mixon:** Okay.
**rellz20 mixon:** So 997, and then the other one was a quarterly.
**rellz20 mixon:** So you guys don't also have it to where.
**rellz20 mixon:** Well, I guess you technically could.
**rellz20 mixon:** We could technically sell data as well.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's correct.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean, we have people all the time that pull lists and then resell.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We actually have one guy who, yeah, he has a license with us and then he's selling the list for about $5,000 a month to roofers.

**rellz20 mixon:** Makes sense.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Makes sense.

**rellz20 mixon:** Makes sense, actually.
**rellz20 mixon:** Why would it be too bad of an idea to.
**rellz20 mixon:** To sell data like that?
**rellz20 mixon:** Watch what are.
**rellz20 mixon:** So right now we're doing the demand automation and I'm doing it under AZ Demand.
**rellz20 mixon:** My business partner and I, Trevor, we are going to launch a total home solution business come Thursday.
**rellz20 mixon:** We're already in the works and everything.
**rellz20 mixon:** Everything getting done and getting our stuff lined up.
**rellz20 mixon:** Let me.
**rellz20 mixon:** Let's revisit come that February time because, I mean, I think the biggest thing is if I don't.
**rellz20 mixon:** If we don't have a limit on how much you guys can pull, then that's going to be a major selling point for us because we have to do it for not only our team, but we have a couple guys out in Washington State and in West Virginia, North Carolina and Texas.
**rellz20 mixon:** And so we want to be able to run some information for them as well.
**rellz20 mixon:** So it would probably benefit us a lot.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So what, what I'll do, Gerald, is I'll put a note to reach out to you after Valentine's weekend.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We might all.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We might all be a little busy on Valentine's weekend, you know, so not gonna bother you on the 14th or the 15th.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But yeah, you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That following week when we do plan to release it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's actually.

**rellz20 mixon:** That's actually perfect.
**rellz20 mixon:** That, that actually would more than likely be perfect timing for us, and it just makes a lot of sense if we can do truly unlimited grab.

**Matthew Bryce:** Really?

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's never going to change, Gerald.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean, we're never like, once you're in on a price, we don't hike those prices.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And we're never going to be like, hey, we're cutting this down to 10 lists or 15 lists or whatever.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's always going to be unlimited.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're fortunate enough to be able to do that.

**rellz20 mixon:** Yeah, that's awesome.
**rellz20 mixon:** I really like that.
