## Transcript

**Jon Kluger:** So I'll run you through a little bit about our platform, give you a high level overview.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll run through an example so you have it for reference and then we can go from there.
**Jon Kluger:** So first thing to tell you a little bit about us.
**Jon Kluger:** So we have an exclusivity contract in terms of the data that we are able to get.
**Jon Kluger:** This is why we're able to outperform our competitors.
**Jon Kluger:** Our data comes from a publicly traded company that usually exclusively works with Fortune 1000 companies charging upwards of six figures a month to access this data.
**Jon Kluger:** What we've been able to do is take through our technical co founder who's been working directly with this data company and Fortune 100 companies for the last 15 years.
**Jon Kluger:** What we've been able to do is get a relationship and a contract where now we're able to leverage this data.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only do we leverage that data, if you imagine a lake, as we call it a data lake, we waterfall enrich 200 more data sets.
**Jon Kluger:** What I mean by that is just like a waterfall into a normal lake.
**Jon Kluger:** It will fill up the rest of any gaps.
**Jon Kluger:** So not only do we leverage Fortune 100 equivalent data, technically ours is better because we have more.
**Jon Kluger:** Why I like to highlight this audience Lab Zoom info, Apollo List Kit, whatever they are, I can confidently tell you as a fact they do not have access to the same data.
**Jon Kluger:** We have higher quality data that updates daily so that you can actually identify those that truly have intent.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we actually include some other really cool features.
**Jon Kluger:** For example, what you're seeing on your screen right now is an overview of our super pixel.
**Jon Kluger:** So may include a super pixel for you, but with us, every single license that you get has five super pixels.
**Jon Kluger:** So when you white label with us, a white label package starts with 10 licenses, that means you get 50 super pixels.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's one thing that's different.
**Jon Kluger:** Why is this important?
**Jon Kluger:** Well, our super pixels, depending on the cookie or the depending on the permissions on each website, can capture 40 to 70% of all website visitors.
**Jon Kluger:** Why is that powerful?
**Jon Kluger:** Well, what happens if someone goes onto your website after you spend all of this effort on paid ads and they don't click anything, they don't do anything, literally.
**Jon Kluger:** You have no idea what happened.
**Jon Kluger:** With us, you're able to capture that.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, you can see literally here we'll use Atlanta for example.
**Jon Kluger:** You can literally see where the website traffic is coming in from.
**Jon Kluger:** So my brother lives right here, so we could tell it's not him.
**Jon Kluger:** I've got family down in Atlanta I'm there a good bit.
**Jon Kluger:** But what this is really nice for is let's say you have a roofing client.
**Jon Kluger:** You can literally see the address of the person visiting your website.

**Brian Chitiyo:** Gotcha.

**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, if we go to the visitor identification.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me walk back in.
**Jon Kluger:** That's cute.
**Jon Kluger:** If we go into the visitor identification tab right here, what you'll see is the actual people that we're pulling that have landed on the website and you can actually see their address, the source.
**Jon Kluger:** And if we scroll over to the right, you can see the user path, where they've gone.
**Jon Kluger:** And here's the really cool part.
**Jon Kluger:** Ready?
**Jon Kluger:** Look at the in depth data that we're able to pull.
**Jon Kluger:** We can tell if they're a renter or a buyer, where they live, how old they are, their contact information, their ip, their behavior, and even the vehicles that they own.

**Brian Chitiyo:** That's powerful.
**Brian Chitiyo:** Wait, is a, is a contact number a cell or a home number?
**Brian Chitiyo:** Do you guys differentiate?

**Jon Kluger:** It depends.
**Jon Kluger:** On.
**Jon Kluger:** On the contact.
**Jon Kluger:** So when we do a data poll here, which we'll do right now, you're going to see, I'll show you the end result.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't worry.
**Jon Kluger:** First thing, advanced search.
**Jon Kluger:** What advanced search is, is think about, we're searching the entire database regardless of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't think about the intent, we don't look at the intent.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you want every CEO of a marketing company with at least 10 employees who makes over a million dollars, this is how you would be able to find it.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, if you want to find people based off of their behavior, we have two other categories.
**Jon Kluger:** Intent.
**Jon Kluger:** B2B is someone buying on behalf of a business.
**Jon Kluger:** So what you can think about this is, for example, HubSpot.
**Jon Kluger:** HubSpot is an option because it's a software sold to businesses.
**Jon Kluger:** Meanwhile, if we go to B2C, this is the end consumer.
**Jon Kluger:** By an end consumer, I mean you, me, Luke, whoever it might be, buy something for themselves.
**Jon Kluger:** You can see something as granular as Toyota.
**Jon Kluger:** Or you could select a RAV4.
**Jon Kluger:** Or you could select a Prius.
**Jon Kluger:** Whatever it is in V1 right now, you have to select from our intent topics in V2, which goes live February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** You can write whatever you want here.
**Jon Kluger:** Nice.

**Brian Chitiyo:** And it builds an audience.
**Brian Chitiyo:** Okay?

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.
**Jon Kluger:** So what we're going to do is we'll do an example loop repair.
**Jon Kluger:** Since you mentioned it, what we're going to select on the intent is two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't look at more than two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** You might go, why?
**Jon Kluger:** Why is that, Jonathan?
**Jon Kluger:** Well, my car wasn't starting this Week I was having issues.
**Jon Kluger:** I looked and did research into a mechanic shop for about two hours.
**Jon Kluger:** I called the mechanic and I got it done.
**Jon Kluger:** Why would I still have intent if my car is already fixed?

**Brian Chitiyo:** That's true.
**Brian Chitiyo:** You don't need correct.

**Jon Kluger:** So we don't want to look at a long term intent because then you're going to be hitting people with paid ads and paid spend that that already probably bought.
**Jon Kluger:** One of the ways that we've been able to save our customers money like this is the fact that our intent data is updated daily means they no longer used outdated lists and they cut the cost of their ad spend in half.
**Jon Kluger:** Typically, not only does their cost get cut in half, they see conversion increase because of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're looking at for this home, we're going to build roof repair.
**Jon Kluger:** We're going to say they're in Atlanta.
**Jon Kluger:** Just for this example, we're going to add a rule that they're a homeowner because it's not really a great idea to be emailing someone who's renting a house.
**Jon Kluger:** They don't care.

**Brian Chitiyo:** That's true.
**Brian Chitiyo:** They don't own that house.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll say yes.
**Jon Kluger:** And then what we'll do is we'll select build audience.
**Jon Kluger:** While this loads, I want to show you something.
**Jon Kluger:** These are all the audiences we've made in the last week.
**Jon Kluger:** This is five hours.
**Jon Kluger:** Do you see we pulled about 3.5 million records.
**Jon Kluger:** This is a real account, this isn't a demo account.
**Jon Kluger:** The same cat experience.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I'm trying to highlight is we don't cap you on audiences, we don't cap you on the number of audiences and we don't cap you.
**Jon Kluger:** We tap you at a million records because that's all that we can query at most.
**Jon Kluger:** But also you shouldn't be targeting a million people at once because that's just going to make your ad spend just crazy.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's go back to this Atlanta one and hit preview.
**Jon Kluger:** We've identified 201 homeowners in Atlanta that have expressed interest for roof repair over the last two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see here is personal phone.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, Direct and mobile.
**Jon Kluger:** So we do have the mobile.
**Jon Kluger:** These are additional personals, these are direct.
**Jon Kluger:** If we scroll to the right, what you'll be able to see is for example, are they married, do they have children, are they a homeowner, what is their business information revenue, employee count, how much money they're making and even how much money they're worth.
**Jon Kluger:** So you go, Jonathan, this is great.
**Jon Kluger:** Do I Have to do this every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a pain in the butt.
**Jon Kluger:** No, don't worry.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't worry, Brian.
**Jon Kluger:** I got you.
**Jon Kluger:** What we're going to do here is we're going to say Atlanta homeowner roof repair.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm going to copy this and hit save.
**Jon Kluger:** This is queued up to be downloadable, easily downloadable.
**Jon Kluger:** But there's something else we can do.
**Jon Kluger:** We can hit schedule.
**Jon Kluger:** This will automatically refresh this list every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, here's a kicker.
**Jon Kluger:** You can even choose to send it to your ad account and have your ad account update look alike or dnc.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, but what it's actually going to do, Brian, is it's going to take the people that are no longer showing intent and it's going to move them out so you no longer waste money targeting someone who's no longer has intent.
**Jon Kluger:** How many times have you gone done research on a product, gone out and bought it and for the next week you get ads.

**Brian Chitiyo:** Yeah, that's true, but I already have the product so I don't need to.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, this helps prevent you from doing that.
**Jon Kluger:** And this allows for you to find a list that works, does really well for you and just continuously update it.

**Brian Chitiyo:** Nice.

**Jon Kluger:** Now you might ask Jonathan.
**Jon Kluger:** It's great.
**Jon Kluger:** How do I do all of this?
**Jon Kluger:** Well, don't worry, we have integrations into all the most common CRMs into your ad account.
**Jon Kluger:** Good.
**Jon Kluger:** High level.
**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what we use.
**Jon Kluger:** We have direct integration.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, this is something that I can tell you for a fact.
**Jon Kluger:** Our buddies over at audience lab don't have Google Ads connector.

**Brian Chitiyo:** So it would work similar to, to pushing your audience to meta.
**Brian Chitiyo:** But you're pushing your Google audience to create a lookalike.
**Brian Chitiyo:** Okay, that's cool.

**Jon Kluger:** And like I said, all of this, 500amonth for a single license.
**Jon Kluger:** Currently.

**Brian Chitiyo:** No, that's.
**Brian Chitiyo:** This is good.
**Brian Chitiyo:** I'm literally gonna share the video and say dude, let's sign up before the 50.
**Brian Chitiyo:** My concern now is missing V2 a good price for V2.

**Jon Kluger:** So if you, if you buy V1, we grandfather you into B2 so you'll be able to not have to worry about a price increase.

**Brian Chitiyo:** What's the, what's the view for white label?
**Brian Chitiyo:** What's the view for our client?
**Brian Chitiyo:** Do you have like a.

**Jon Kluger:** So if you were to white label this, not say our name, it would say your company name.

**Brian Chitiyo:** Awesome.

**Jon Kluger:** Every client would have their own login and each client would have their own license.
**Jon Kluger:** Label starts at $3,000 a month, but it comes with 10 licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** So what that means is your average cost per license on an annual is $300.
**Jon Kluger:** But here's the best part, Brian.
**Jon Kluger:** Every license you add after the first license is only $100.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you add 10 more licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** Your average cost per license drops to $200 if you do annual drops.

**Brian Chitiyo:** So annual payment is okay?
**Brian Chitiyo:** No, we usually do annual, but always the first month is going to be just a regular.

**Jon Kluger:** That's what we want you to do.
**Jon Kluger:** We want you to try the first month in regular.
**Jon Kluger:** And then if it feels good, you like your results, everything's going well.
**Jon Kluger:** You switch over the white label, we can get you set up with exactly what you need.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll teach you how to use the platform you'll be using.
**Jon Kluger:** And I can guarantee these white label prices for V2 if you sign up for a single license of V1.
**Jon Kluger:** I can promise you that.

**Brian Chitiyo:** Okay, that sounds good.
**Brian Chitiyo:** All right, I need him to come.
**Brian Chitiyo:** Since he's a big hand setup, see how fast he will.
**Brian Chitiyo:** Can you do this?
**Brian Chitiyo:** You say you might have times available tomorrow.
**Brian Chitiyo:** Can you just give me times you're available tomorrow then?
**Brian Chitiyo:** Then solid us out for Monday though options for tomorrow so we get moving.

**Jon Kluger:** Sorry, my.
**Jon Kluger:** My roommate came back and my dog decided he wanted to lose his mind.
**Jon Kluger:** Tomorrow I'm available between.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, if we have power, assuming the snow doesn't knock us out, I've got time between 3:45 and 4:15.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm available before noon and I should have some time in the evening.
**Jon Kluger:** On Sunday I'm free before 11:30 in the morning.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm also free between 3:15 and 4:15.
**Jon Kluger:** And then next week I have availability throughout the week as well.

**Brian Chitiyo:** If we don't do it tomorrow at 4:15 or Sunday at 4:15, it'll be Monday, but I'm guessing tomorrow.
**Brian Chitiyo:** I think he comes in around 2 in the afternoon.
**Brian Chitiyo:** He should be ready.

**Jon Kluger:** So let me confirm my.
**Jon Kluger:** My meetings for tomorrow.
**Jon Kluger:** It might be at 5:00'.
**Jon Kluger:** Clock.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm just looking.
**Jon Kluger:** Something just got added to my calendar.
**Jon Kluger:** Literally.

**Brian Chitiyo:** Yeah, tomorrow evening or Sunday evening is all.
**Brian Chitiyo:** Anything after.
**Brian Chitiyo:** After three, after 4pm Is fine.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Brian Chitiyo:** I can't guarantee that.
**Brian Chitiyo:** It depends on him because.
**Brian Chitiyo:** But Monday definitely.

**Jon Kluger:** So let me do this.
**Jon Kluger:** Brian, I'm gonna take your invite, I'm gonna take your contact info for 5pm tomorrow.
