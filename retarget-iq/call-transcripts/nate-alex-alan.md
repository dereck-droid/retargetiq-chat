## Transcript

**Alex Ciereszko:** So you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Have you seen the ads that Audience Lab is running against us?

**A L:** Hold on one second.

**Alex Ciereszko:** No worries.

**A L:** I've seen your ads against them, which I love.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, they're running ads against us.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Are you familiar with Data Shopper?

**A L:** No.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, so Datashop are pretty much the same platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We are all merging together and that was part of the reason.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I know both Thomas and Nate at this moment have calls going on, but I'm just trying to rally them in here so we can all chat with you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But we are basically merging.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're trying to become the best.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's why I wanted Thomas on this, because he talks that language that you speak with all the tech.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But we're going to be merging and basically just building the best platform we can be miles ahead of.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Of Audience Lab.

**A L:** Okay, let me see if I can.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Get a text back.

**A L:** Does that mean I'm going to get in a different platform or is it your.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, no, it's going to be.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's going to be just an upgraded platform, so more features built in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Enrichment, more email validation.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I know you mentioned stuff about the email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I spoke to Thomas about that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's not really too much of my language with what you guys do with the email stuff, but I think it's all worth the conversation to have.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And that was really the point of this call.

**A L:** Okay.
**A L:** All right.
**A L:** Well, until he comes, let's just talk real fast.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, for sure.

**A L:** Tell me, is there a way for me to upload suppression files so that I can.
**A L:** Let's say I have 20 million names I don't want.
**A L:** Is there a way for me to.
**A L:** Suppress that against the query?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Unfortunately, right now, no.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But I'd be happy to bring that to the table.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Al.

**A L:** Okay.
**A L:** APIs?
**A L:** Yes.
**A L:** It's a little bit cumbersome running these queries.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Did I send you API access?

**A L:** No.
**A L:** Let's.
**A L:** Let's log into the thing.
**A L:** No worries.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me take care of that right now.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We charge extra for API.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm not going to bill you, Alan.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're just gonna.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm just gonna get that code for you, okay?

**A L:** Yeah.
**A L:** Why do you charge extra for APIs?

**Alex Ciereszko:** We discount ourselves a lot on the actual platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So we add it as an extra 297 offer.

**A L:** Right.
**A L:** Let me know when it's done.

**Alex Ciereszko:** We generate this key.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Alan, where are you located?

**A L:** In South Florida.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, you're so lucky, man.

**A L:** Down the block from Zeta's.
**A L:** One of their.
**A L:** I think your corporate headquarters are in Boca, right?
**A L:** Aren't they?

**Alex Ciereszko:** No way.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Are you serious?

**A L:** I Think Zeta's got an office in Boca?

**Alex Ciereszko:** I believe they do.

**A L:** I know you guys are there.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's awesome.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** API key.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Do you want me to email this for you or you want me to drop it in the chat?

**A L:** Email it.
**A L:** Okay, email it.
**A L:** And so then how do I use this?
**A L:** Can you walk me through it?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's another reason I'd love to have Nate on this call.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We actually have API docs, Alan, on our website.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Do you want me to attach those as well?
**Alex Ciereszko:** That explain.

**A L:** Attach the API docs.
**A L:** But if you can just.
**A L:** Have you used them at all?
**A L:** Do you know how to use them?

**Alex Ciereszko:** I personally.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm personally not the best with them, Alan.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll be completely honest with you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I usually just provide them to people, but we can certainly help you with it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I can get you help on it.

**A L:** All right.
**A L:** Attached.

**Alex Ciereszko:** API key.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There we go.

**A L:** I could have sworn we were able.
**A L:** To, on the audiences, maybe yours on.
**A L:** The intent beta to see that the topic.
**A L:** We had multiple topics.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Unable to at the moment.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Alan, I know you asked about that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think it may have been.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I was kind of shooting through it really quick.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It may have looked like I selected multiples, but it's only topic by topic right now.

**A L:** Got it.
**A L:** Okay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** We are also releasing terms, so, like actual search terms.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you're going to be able to go in and we're actually going to be able to release terms by request.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let's say we don't have a topic or a term.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can go in and just request those and we can get access to it for you.

**A L:** Okay, cool.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me add these docs in this email as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Sorry, Alan.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I really wanted these guys in this call.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't know.

**A L:** Schedule another call.
**A L:** I. I'm.
**A L:** We're.
**A L:** We're banging.
**A L:** We're always.
**A L:** I'm always busy now, so we can do this on the next call.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**A L:** And then I do have another question for you.
**A L:** Whenever.
**A L:** Whenever you're done, let me know.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm going to attach this as a link.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is being sent over to you now.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Perfect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You should have that email in your inbox.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm all ears.

**A L:** Let me just go check.
**A L:** You're targeting Pixel.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.

**A L:** It has.
**A L:** I. I'm looking at it right now.
**A L:** I think it's under Websites, right?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Correct.

**A L:** And if you click add a website.
**A L:** No, that's not it.
**A L:** Where is the visitor identification?
**A L:** How do I add a pixel?
**A L:** Where is this?
**A L:** It was under websites.
**A L:** I think it was.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes, under Websites, it should say add new.

**A L:** Okay.
**A L:** All right.
**A L:** So besides websites, if I go click.
**A L:** Edit, if I look for the pixel actions right, and you have this script, I'm going to share this with you.
**A L:** Let me share my screen, okay?
**A L:** Oh, that's not it.
**A L:** Sorry, I'm not used to.
**A L:** Let me know if you can see it.
**A L:** You there?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, yeah, I see it.

**A L:** Okay.
**A L:** We're Infinity mirror.
**A L:** Don't share your entire screen.
**A L:** Share my screen anyway.
**A L:** You see this pixel over here?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.

**A L:** Is there a way to get retarget iq?
**A L:** Can we get our domain in there instead of yours?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, that's a great question.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I can screenshot this and ask Samir developer right now.

**A L:** I've done this before with other identity pixels.
**A L:** Cname in place wherever you guys do.
**A L:** It, there's like an IP address or something just so that when I hand.
**A L:** It out, it's not showing yours.
**A L:** I really don't want to tell people where we're getting our stuff from.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, all good.

**A L:** Yeah.
**A L:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Come on.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You don't want to give us free advertising.

**A L:** I. I want to sell your stuff.
**A L:** And be, you know, and then up later on and create an API and, you know, private label and become one of your larger clients.

**Alex Ciereszko:** There we go.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Thomas.

**Thomas Rudy:** Hey, what's up, everybody?

**A L:** Hey, nice to meet you.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Alan, this is Thomas.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Thomas is the founder of Data Shopper.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're going to be merging up here together.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I just wanted.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Thomas, I just wanted to put us all on a call here because I know Alan had some.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Some technical questions, and they're a little bit above my.
**Alex Ciereszko:** My grade of knowledge here on the back end.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But, Alan, I know you have some interesting stuff as well that I think could help us out in the future.

**A L:** Cool.

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, happy to field any questions.

**A L:** All right, cool.
**A L:** So I had some questions.
**A L:** Last seen and Active dates, What's like.
**A L:** What's the difference?
**A L:** Like, you're running these date ranges the.
**A L:** Last two weeks, and then I'm downloading the file and I'm seeing active from 2022.
**A L:** So what is that all about?
**A L:** If you're running.
**A L:** What is the date range even doing then?
**A L:** If last active was.
**A L:** Was a year ago.

**Thomas Rudy:** Which filter is it?
**Thomas Rudy:** That might just be an error.

**A L:** Anything.
**A L:** If you just download the file, you'll see.
**A L:** You'll see any kind of file.
**A L:** Let me just go.
**A L:** So I'm gonna have to rerun the queries, right?
**A L:** Once we download it.
**A L:** Let me just see.
**A L:** Let me go to my downloads folder.

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, Honestly, we just integrated another feed.
**Thomas Rudy:** It's very possible that that's an error.
**Thomas Rudy:** There's like a. I don't Know if you know, this is Alex.
**Thomas Rudy:** But this morning there were some, some queries that were returning the wrong data.
**Thomas Rudy:** So our cloud team is actively working on it.
**Thomas Rudy:** That is most likely what's going on right now.

**A L:** All right, so you see over here, hold on.
**A L:** This is a. I think this is your file.
**A L:** I'm guessing it is because it has most of this stuff in here.
**A L:** Looks like we have.
**A L:** Where is it?
**A L:** Business email, last seen.
**A L:** Now it's an easier way to do this.
**A L:** Hold on.
**A L:** So here's your columns.
**A L:** I don't know if you can see this score category.
**A L:** Let me just see if I can find.
**A L:** Last updated.
**A L:** I don't know if it's.
**A L:** Last updated was a personal email last seen.
**A L:** I remember that there.
**A L:** Personal email last seen.
**A L:** See that, that's on column 10.
**A L:** So if we're pulling this data and.
**A L:** The personal email is from 2025 and your query is in the last two weeks, like if you run an audience thing, you can't run anything past before two weeks.
**A L:** That's confusing.
**A L:** I don't know what that means.
**A L:** You guys there?
**A L:** Did I lose you?

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm here.

**A L:** Thomas, you there?

**Thomas Rudy:** Sorry, I was on mute.
**Thomas Rudy:** I was talking like an idiot.
**Thomas Rudy:** But I, I can almost guarantee you that's because of some of the cloud movements that we're doing because we have a new partner that's actually going to validate the emails every month.
**Thomas Rudy:** So I think what you're just seeing is just like a bug in our system that will get fixed.
**Thomas Rudy:** But if you want, you can send me what your appropriate query would be in the meantime and I can pull it and then just send it to you directly.

**A L:** But no, we can pull it.
**A L:** That's not an issue.
**A L:** I mean we've been in the data.
**A L:** Business for a long time.
**A L:** Pulling it is not the issue, it's just understanding, just understanding the way what the fields actually mean.
**A L:** So if you have a data dictionary.
**A L:** That tells me, you know, I mean a lot of these are, you know, self explanatory.

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, I can send you the data dictionary for sure.

**A L:** And then what's the best practices on your system to pull data like valid ESP and valid digital?
**A L:** Like I don't know what the difference between that is.
**A L:** I mean I'm looking at.
**A L:** It's a personal email address.
**A L:** So what's the actual difference in, in that.
**A L:** You know what I mean?

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, I mean the best way to pull data is going to be the.

**A L:** Recency flag, which is what is this?
**A L:** This date, range, event date, recently updated.
**A L:** I only have event date.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So is There another.

**Thomas Rudy:** You should have recently updated.
**Thomas Rudy:** Just type in R. There you go, all the way down.
**Thomas Rudy:** Record last updated.

**A L:** Sorry, got it.

**Thomas Rudy:** And then if you add flags, like contains URL.

**A L:** Are you.

**Thomas Rudy:** Is this all B2B email?

**A L:** No, it's B2C.
**A L:** Mostly our main business is B2C.
**A L:** If, if your data is as good as I think it is, we, we.
**A L:** Have had a lot of requests for B2B data, but we just never found.
**A L:** A vendor we really trusted.
**A L:** It's kind of been opaque on the.
**A L:** B2B side, so if that's the case, we will be able to pull B2B data.

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, I mean, that's.
**Thomas Rudy:** Actually, we're currently working through that today to integrate this other partner that's going to validate the emails for us every month.
**Thomas Rudy:** So.
**Thomas Rudy:** Okay, you'll still have like.
**Thomas Rudy:** I mean what we're scoring at is like 95% like out of the box, like what will be a green flag on the email.
**Thomas Rudy:** But you know, obviously if someone does something in a month's time, you still gotta validate it, but.

**A L:** Right.

**Thomas Rudy:** But yeah, I can send you the data dictionary.
**Thomas Rudy:** Sorry, I'm like straddling a call because this one wasn't on my calendar.
**Thomas Rudy:** I just completely forgot about it.
**Thomas Rudy:** So apologies there.

**A L:** And can we select feeds on the output?
**A L:** Let's say we don't want all this stuff.
**A L:** I mean, we can ingest it, it's fine.
**A L:** I just, you know, wanted to know if we could select fields.
**A L:** Yeah, like what?
**A L:** Last updated?

**Alex Ciereszko:** What is that?

**A L:** So what's the machine.
**A L:** Last updated and last seen, Those are two different things.
**A L:** And then over here you have, you have last updated, last seen.
**A L:** And then you have record last updated over here on the condition.
**A L:** So which one is which?

**Thomas Rudy:** Last seen is in relation to the emails themselves.
**Thomas Rudy:** Record is like the entire record.
**Thomas Rudy:** So if a record, it's not necessarily like in relation to the email.
**Thomas Rudy:** It could be like, you know, their name was updated if they got married.

**A L:** Or.

**Thomas Rudy:** Like anything in the record.

**A L:** Got it.
**A L:** So something was updated.
**A L:** Yeah, I'm looking for signals, like recent signals on that.
**A L:** They.
**A L:** Let's just say like we have a gold client.
**A L:** Right.
**A L:** So they're looking for gold coins.
**A L:** Right.
**A L:** So I want to know what's the most recent data, you know, and I want to pull this weekly.
**A L:** Let's just say, you know, we're every two or once a week or once.
**A L:** Let's just say daily, you know, the 28th to the 28th, we pull a file, it exports.
**A L:** So I want to see everybody from yesterday that, you know, look for Gold coins.
**A L:** What, what am I looking for here?
**A L:** Do I have to limit this?
**A L:** Like if I pull this without record last updated.
**A L:** I'll get a bunch of these.
**A L:** These files I'll get, I'll get a.
**A L:** The subs.
**A L:** The set is, is bigger because the last scene will go back earlier than personal email last seen.
**A L:** So what I'm really looking for is somebody that opened or clicked or did something.
**A L:** Yeah, no, I, I, I mean technicians really.
**A L:** And you got to tell me best practices on how to pull this instead of me guessing.

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, I mean first, like I don't know if I'm explaining this correctly, but there's a current bug happening that is problematic in our system.
**Thomas Rudy:** So we need to fix that and that's due to the fact that we're ingesting another fee.
**Thomas Rudy:** That's this email partner.
**Thomas Rudy:** So.

**A L:** Okay.

**Thomas Rudy:** I think that that will be resolved in the next few hours.
**Thomas Rudy:** If you want in the meantime I can give you data dictionary in the exact query that I would do.

**A L:** Sure.

**Thomas Rudy:** That might be a good precursor but yeah, like apologies sometimes.

**A L:** Listen, Beta, I'll be your like what my talent is finding bugs in systems and so I'm not complaining.
**A L:** I'm communicating and giving you feedback that you actually want without being upset.

**Thomas Rudy:** So yeah, no worries.

**A L:** A client that'll tell you like I.
**A L:** We'Re a power user so we're going.
**A L:** To run through it and start doing stuff and we're going to find stuff.
**A L:** Nothing is a complaint, it's just feedback.
**A L:** From our side and we're here to make the whole thing better and hum properly.

**Thomas Rudy:** So yeah honestly appreciate that and if.

**A L:** You ever want me to test bugs or test something and just go go at it, we'll do that too.

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, you might be a great candidate to test the V2 that's coming out.
**Thomas Rudy:** That's what I was really access to that.
**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's why I wanted to get Alan on the call and just all of us on the call together because I spoke to him.
**Alex Ciereszko:** At first I thought he was upset with me, but just a straightforward guy.

**A L:** That's why we don't pull punches.
**A L:** Thomas.
**A L:** We have a data company.
**A L:** We used to provide data to Zeta years ago.
**A L:** So we were very.
**A L:** We provide data to some of the.
**A L:** Largest email publishers on the planet.
**A L:** We take in about 3 million records a day.
**A L:** I have 1.4 billion records de duped.
**A L:** And 14 billion non deduped.
**A L:** So we're constantly pulling in data.

**Thomas Rudy:** So what company is that?

**A L:** It's right there.
**A L:** Digital Bulldogs.

**Thomas Rudy:** Oh, okay.
**Thomas Rudy:** Gotcha.
**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, interesting.
**Thomas Rudy:** Well maybe there's like a something we can do on that front too.

**A L:** Yeah, that's what I had mentioned to Alex.
**A L:** If you need a data partner, you know, we have a couple dozen data providers.
**A L:** We have, you know, crap feeds and.
**A L:** We have super premium feeds that come.
**A L:** From $200 million e commerce as seen on TV companies.
**A L:** So we, I have across the gamut.
**A L:** I'll let you know what's what.
**A L:** So we could become a data provider for you guys.
**A L:** And then the other thing is that I was telling Alex that a lot of your clients are going to be B2B cold email guys.
**A L:** And we actually mail internally and have a Gmail warm up seating system we use internally that mails out and mimics.
**A L:** Human behavior to create engagement.
**A L:** That you could add on as an.
**A L:** Upsell and private label to your clients.
**A L:** Because if they're mailing B2B cold email and they can warm up their services, their IP address and their domain before.
**A L:** They mail, then that's a, that's a natural upsell.

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, I mean honestly, we have a.
**Thomas Rudy:** In the queue is like a partner network for people that do those exact same things.
**Thomas Rudy:** Okay, so like I don't even think we.
**Thomas Rudy:** Alex, we gotta talk about this more.
**Thomas Rudy:** But we've talked about it not being like even like a commission thing.
**Thomas Rudy:** Just like here's the partners that can help use the data the most effectively and just send people your way.
**Thomas Rudy:** So like cold email is an easy one.

**A L:** 1.

**Thomas Rudy:** And then like, you know, paid ad management is another easy one.
**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, so yeah, we want to do that.
**Thomas Rudy:** We're trying to think like how to put that together.
**Thomas Rudy:** But yeah, I mean in its very simplest form, we could just shoot people your way.

**A L:** To be honest, the way to put it together is you shoot people my way, I talk to them, I find.
**A L:** Out what the market is actually doing.
**A L:** And then I come back to you.
**A L:** Guys and I say based on your referrals, this is what we're seeing.
**A L:** If we, if we productize this and.
**A L:** Then turn it into.
**A L:** As part of, as another add on onto your system, this might work.
**A L:** And then we'll have wikis and tutorials and you know, onboard everything will be automated.
**A L:** So I'll build it manually and then.
**A L:** Come back to you after the model is proven.
**A L:** So instead of thinking about how to.
**A L:** Do it, the market tells us what they want.
**A L:** And I'm the one telling you what.
**A L:** The market wants because I'm selling them the product.

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, I mean those are partnerships we definitely want to engage in.

**A L:** Yeah, we have like a, we have.

**Thomas Rudy:** Some ducks to get in A row in the next week or two, but absolutely.
**Thomas Rudy:** I mean, for sure.

**A L:** And then.

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah.
**Thomas Rudy:** Let me just ping you when I know that this bug is fixed.
**Thomas Rudy:** And in the meantime, we can live.

**A L:** With what you got.
**A L:** Thomas, don't worry about it.
**A L:** I just don't.
**A L:** There's no pressure from our side.
**A L:** I can use the data the way it is and then it.
**A L:** We can use it even better when.
**A L:** You fix your bug.
**A L:** So there's absolutely no pressure from us.
**A L:** We.
**A L:** We're your friends.
**A L:** I get you guys.
**A L:** Don't worry.

**Thomas Rudy:** Yeah, no.
**Thomas Rudy:** Appreciate the feedback too.

**A L:** And we're.

**Thomas Rudy:** I think it would make sense to get you as like a beta tester on the V2, so.
**Thomas Rudy:** All right, we'll coordinate that.
**Thomas Rudy:** It's going to have a lot prettier interface and it's going to be much more advanced than some of the feature sets.
**Thomas Rudy:** Alex, I don't know if you shared him the list of things that are coming out, but.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Not yet.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mentioned a few, Thomas, but.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But not fully yet.

**Thomas Rudy:** Okay, cool.

**A L:** All right.
**A L:** All right.
**A L:** Nice to meet you, Ty.
**A L:** I know you're straddling calls.
**A L:** I'll let you go and I'll finish.
**A L:** The call with Alex.

**Thomas Rudy:** All right, cool.
**Thomas Rudy:** We'll be in touch soon.
**Thomas Rudy:** Thanks, man.

**A L:** Thank you.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Thanks, Thomas.

**A L:** All right, Alex.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Alan.

**A L:** Cool.

**Alex Ciereszko:** What's going on?

**A L:** So how are you going to do this V2?
**A L:** Do you want to.
**A L:** Should I wait?
**A L:** Can you.
**A L:** When can I see that?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, honestly, Alan, I would wait for.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right now.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I have a list of features that Thomas had sent me.

**A L:** V2 features.
**A L:** Okay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Built in email validation.

**A L:** Okay, I'm actually gonna.
**A L:** Let me.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me drop this in the chat here for us so then you can follow along with this.

**A L:** Hold on, let me just see when my next call is so.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, good.

**A L:** Focus properly.
**A L:** Yeah, we have time.
**A L:** All right.
**A L:** All right.
**A L:** So built in email evaluation.
**A L:** Proof connectors with one click off.
**A L:** Okay.
**A L:** Increase in 10 and intent topics.
**A L:** Improved audience builder, UI good.
**A L:** More data fields.
**A L:** Automated daily performance, API logging, NAD and sequence builder.
**A L:** Could sub license white labels.
**A L:** Can white label built in email sending.
**A L:** Good.
**A L:** So if you have the built in email setting on 2.5, you probably.
**A L:** If you add in the built in.
**A L:** Warm up service and then we integrate our warm up service.
**A L:** That's.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's from what you told me last time.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think that'd be pretty kick ass.

**A L:** Yeah.
**A L:** Yeah.
**A L:** And this is different than the other warm up services.
**A L:** This is.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I believe it.

**A L:** It's.
**A L:** It's like.
**A L:** It's like 3.0.
**A L:** It's like it matches it matches your.
**A L:** Your version numbers.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And there might be more to, like, we're constantly, like, you know, credit ranges are going to be displayed.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, there's smaller things like that that are.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That we also got to compile, but this is the general logistics of what we're trying to push out.

**A L:** Cool.
**A L:** All right.
**A L:** All right.
**A L:** So cool.
**A L:** So I'm waiting on you to find out.
**A L:** I'm going to wait on Thomas for.
**A L:** The data dictionary and the way he.
**A L:** Would pull the query.
**A L:** You're going to let me know on the pixel.
**A L:** Absolutely.
**A L:** You're going to let me know on the V2 when that's available?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes, sir.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're shooting for February 15th, so just have that, you know, mental date there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're shooting for that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know how development goes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Sometimes it gets pushed back, but we're.

**A L:** Shooting to me if I need to be a beta tester so that I can test before you roll it out.
**A L:** Well, we'll get in there and I'll.
**A L:** Tell you everything because I.
**A L:** You saw how I ran through everything.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm like, you did Exactly.

**A L:** Yeah.
**A L:** And I also was able to update.
**A L:** Your quiz queries so I could get multiple intents.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, you did?

**A L:** Yeah, yeah.
**A L:** I didn't want to talk.
**A L:** Yeah, yeah.
**A L:** So you.
**A L:** If you want to see how, I'll show you how.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, please show me how.

**A L:** Because I. I ran the ira.
**A L:** This is between.
**A L:** Don't turn it off for me.
**A L:** But I ran.
**A L:** Yeah, I ran the audiences, saved the.
**A L:** Query and then went in and then under Actions edit, and then we updated.

**Alex Ciereszko:** The query in here, and now it's running itself.

**A L:** Yeah, I got it completed.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, that is sweet.

**Thomas Rudy:** All right.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Well, there we go.

**A L:** Yeah, but we can do it.
**A L:** It's a pain in the ass.
**A L:** I think you guys did it so that people wouldn't overwhelm your system.
**A L:** Exactly.
**A L:** But the queries are the.
**A L:** The volume is so low on some of these that you need.
**A L:** I. I had to run multiple saved audiences.
**A L:** It's not a big deal.
**A L:** Like, if you give me once the API is done.
**A L:** Oh, that's the other thing.
**A L:** I need API done that over to you.
**A L:** Okay, let me look at that real fast.
**A L:** Once that's done, we can build these out with the multiple ones and it'll.
**A L:** Work just fine because then I just have to set it up three times.
**A L:** The API will come in, and then.
**A L:** We'Re kind of good to go.
**A L:** So this is the key, these are the dots.
**A L:** So getting started.
**A L:** Let me just look real fast.
**A L:** So there's no real.
**A L:** This is the documentation, but don't you have to enable it on your side?

**Alex Ciereszko:** It's already enabled from my understanding, Alan.

**A L:** So how would I do it?

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's a great question, man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I. I send over those logins.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Alan, I can 100 get you an answer on that.

**A L:** Yeah, just tell me where in your system I start.
**A L:** Like, which, like integrations is usually like.
**A L:** An API or it goes under audiences.
**A L:** Where the safe query.
**A L:** Let me just look at save query real fast actions.
**A L:** There is no.
**A L:** It says export to CSV schedule sent to ad account.
**A L:** It doesn't send, say send to API.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.

**A L:** Am I pulling from your system or is it posting?

**Alex Ciereszko:** It should be.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Pull.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It should be.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So whatever the receiving end is, that's where the API key should go.

**A L:** So we'll pull from our side to your side, correct?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes, I do understand that side at least.

**A L:** Right.
**A L:** So we're pulling it in.
**A L:** You're not actually posting out.
**A L:** There's two ways it works.
**A L:** One, you, I run the query, the query is done, and it posts out.
**A L:** Right.
**A L:** That's what you're doing with the ad account.
**A L:** Google.
**A L:** Okay.
**A L:** Correct.
**A L:** One is my system sends a request to you guys and pulls in.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's how it would be.

**A L:** Right.
**A L:** So I have to run that and pull it in.

**Alex Ciereszko:** But let me get an answer on that, Alan.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because we're trying to put together a whole compilation of videos on, like, every aspect of the tool.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And because we're trying to release V2 and do all of that, it's also like we're putting out all those videos just to delete all of them and then redo it for V2.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So let me figure out a way I can either send you a loom or get my hands on it on some sort of video script that explains all that.

**A L:** Okay, no problem.
**A L:** All right.
**A L:** You did great.
**A L:** All right, so do you want to set up another call for next Thursday?
**A L:** Are we good for now or.

**Alex Ciereszko:** You tell me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You tell me.

**A L:** I'd like to move forward.
**A L:** On what?
**A L:** We just like to touch base and ask a couple of questions.
**A L:** So let's book another call for.
**A L:** Do you want to use.
**A L:** Can you schedule it for next week?

**Alex Ciereszko:** 100.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll move this one over to next week.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Thursday.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let's do the same time.

**A L:** No problem.
**A L:** You are a gentleman.
**A L:** I appreciate you and.
**A L:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Appreciate you, Alan.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You're helping us out, man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's why I wanted to get you on the call.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because we started running with this thing, we started selling it like hotcakes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But the internals, you know, the videos, the.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The API, like that, that needs to be done, man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, because we get questions like this all the time, and I'm sitting here like, hey, you know, we need to help these people.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you're smart enough to understand 99 of this stuff, so.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.

**A L:** Yeah, no problem.
**A L:** You got.
**A L:** You're doing great.
**A L:** You guys are going to be fantastic.
**A L:** Hopefully, we'll grow this to very nice numbers.
**A L:** Okay?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Hope so, too, Alan.

**A L:** Take care.

**Alex Ciereszko:** All right, brother.

**Thomas Rudy:** Bye.

**A L:** Bye.
