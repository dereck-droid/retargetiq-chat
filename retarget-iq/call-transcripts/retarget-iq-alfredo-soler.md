## Transcript

**Alex Ciereszko:** You taking the reins on this thing, man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because I've been juggling so much support today and just running around.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'll be here the whole time.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if, you know, hopefully he shows up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's 4:30, so.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I'm.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm hoping that he does.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But yeah, at any point, if you get stuck on anything or whatever, just say, hey, I think Alex would be great to answer this and I'll, I'll certainly step in and help you out, brother.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, sounds good.
**Matthew Bryce:** How'd the earlier call go?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Confusing as hell, Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean, you know, white label is one thing, but it's a, it's just a whole nother beast than just selling a single license.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because people are like, hey, like your logo's here, but your domain.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, like, it's all those questions.

**Matthew Bryce:** Of having deeper because then their brand is on it.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Exactly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But we got it all figured out.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It ended up really well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This guy's super happy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I'm excited to see just where he kind of gets his own stuff too.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think he's already working with a bunch of dental practices, so it's gonna be easy for him to just, you know, push it to those practices.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think he already has like two that are technically signed up with us now under the white label.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's awesome.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So, yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** But yeah, and I was taking a look at sales flow that Alfred is gonna be joining where he's from, and I'm wondering if that might be an angle that he has because, you know, the website he has is.
**Matthew Bryce:** Seems pretty robust in what they offer.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know, probably just looking for data.
**Matthew Bryce:** I mean, probably not just looking for data.
**Matthew Bryce:** So let's see what he says.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yep.
**Alex Ciereszko:** 100.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's actually interesting because when I looked it up earlier, it was like this guy Besnik that came up on, came up on Forbes, but that's obviously not him.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's why I'm curious to see what this guy's doing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Their companies are either like the same or very similar to it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Interesting.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But yeah, we'll see what he's.
**Alex Ciereszko:** What he does.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I guess the snow's supposed to miss us too, Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** Which I'm really happy about because we.
**Matthew Bryce:** We can't do anymore.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I, I was literally at the bank today, Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I had a meeting at 12 o' clock to get some stuff done for our bank account.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And I walked in the door at 12:32 because the whole city was just absolutely packed in with snow.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then the one street that was actually available, it Was like temporary police order.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like can't, you know.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I was like, dude, you got to be kidding.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then, you know, it's funny, I finally just parked there and I was like, you know what?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, if you guys want to write me a ticket, like, just write me the ticket.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** And a sheriff pulls up right behind me to go into the bank as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And I'm like, so do I get the ticket or like, who's writing it?
**Alex Ciereszko:** And he's like, dude, nobody cares.
**Alex Ciereszko:** He's like, just get your stuff done.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, there's way too much snow and issues to be worried about you parking there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yep, it's true.

**Matthew Bryce:** It's like nobody could park when we're doing drop off for school.
**Matthew Bryce:** Normally doors are open at 8:20 and it closes at 8:30, so you have 10 minutes.
**Matthew Bryce:** But there's just so much snow people can't park.
**Matthew Bryce:** So everybody has to do the drop off line.
**Matthew Bryce:** And it's like 8:35 and you like, we're there at 8:15, it's 8:35 and we're just pulling up.
**Matthew Bryce:** So it's, it's just a mess.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Right?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Real quick, Matt, I'm just gonna ping this guy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm gonna shoot him a text, see if he's still planning on showing up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** How are you feeling with everything?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Are you feeling a little bit warmed up?
**Alex Ciereszko:** I was on with Trevor yesterday.
**Alex Ciereszko:** He seemed pretty good.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I pretty much stole the kill for him because he.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There was like some very technical questions that I don't expect you guys to know and he didn't know that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I just kept going along with the, with the answers.
**Alex Ciereszko:** What I told Trevor is like, at any point, if you guys get like caught up on anything or you're a little confused, just be like, hey, you know what, I'm just getting started here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I know this at a very broad, you know, spot.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But let me connect you with my founder, Alex, and literally, Matt, you can, you can, you know, grab, grab the person's email and grab my email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just shoot me an email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just be like, hey, I was just on the call with Jeff or Alfred.
**Alex Ciereszko:** He wanted to follow up on this and this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Could you connect with him?
**Alex Ciereszko:** And I can even go and like follow up on a call as well with them if an email doesn't help.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But, but yeah, just, just so, you know, just so it takes the pressure off you guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I actually think the approach of being like, hey, like I, I'm just getting started here, you know, I think it actually helps you guys, to be honest.

**Matthew Bryce:** You know, I Couldn't agree more.
**Matthew Bryce:** When it comes to that.
**Matthew Bryce:** It's like, you know, we're just getting off the ground so that we might not be able to answer some questions.
**Matthew Bryce:** And honesty, I always say, is the best.
**Matthew Bryce:** So rather than trying to make something up or even saying, I don't know which is more of, you know, I'm just getting off the ground.
**Matthew Bryce:** And this is a question that I'm not 100% sure on, so I'll get back to you on it.
**Matthew Bryce:** And.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I'm going to loop the founder and Alex just to make sure that we get the right answer for you type of thing.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, no, that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's perfect, man.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And that's what I told Trevor.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And I think that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think it makes it more fun for you guys too, because then the people are like, oh, they actually care, instead of trying to just like, you know, you know.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So.

**Matthew Bryce:** I always say everybody has a bullshit meter.
**Matthew Bryce:** And, oh, yeah, if they start.
**Matthew Bryce:** If that bullshit meter starts to go way too high, you lose all credibility.
**Matthew Bryce:** And that's.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I've done the same thing, Matt.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, I don't go on saying that I'm the founder or anything.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I just go on.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Then I'm like, hey, you know what?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me reach out to my dev team.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because there's times like today, dude, they pushed out an update and I was like, in the integrations tab, I'm like, what the hell?
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is new, you know?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, we're going to work on the videos too, man.

**Matthew Bryce:** We need.

**Alex Ciereszko:** We need to make all the support videos to just help people out because it's.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's gonna be.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's gonna be hard for.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Be like we keep getting the same.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, you know, the same emails over and over.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's literally all I've been doing in between anything.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm just like jumping on troubleshoots.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So makes sense.

**Matthew Bryce:** And I'm sure it's all.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like there's probably all one similar pain point, which I believe it seems like, which will be addressed in v2.
**Matthew Bryce:** Maybe it's the webhooks.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, that's been a little confusing for people because it's basically located in the back end of the integrations.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If anybody ever asks you, you say, hey, when you go ahead and integrate with one of the integration tabs, it'll populate for you that you can put in there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's what I like to tell people.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're trying to make that easier too, Matt, because, I mean, that's been.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We've gotten so many messages and texts about that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, wait, where's the webhook URL?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Where's the webhook URL?
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then even when you explain it, they still don't generally know where to go with it.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, they have to be, you know, Although I've.
**Matthew Bryce:** I've seen and heard webhooks are relatively easy, that you don't need to be super technical.
**Matthew Bryce:** You need to be somewhat technical.
**Matthew Bryce:** And, I mean, I know nothing when it comes to that.
**Matthew Bryce:** So when I was watching all the videos and I see people mentioning webhooks.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm like, don't ask me 100%.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I feel like got no response from this guy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All right, if.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you want to run a demo with me, Matt, you could.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You could pitch me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm trying to get out of here by 5:15, because I want to spend, like, the last two hours of the day just cleaning everything up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But if you want to go, not, like, if you want to knock something out here in the next 30 minutes and just pitch me, I can be Alfredo and just join.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, I was gonna say I'd love to do that.
**Matthew Bryce:** Then do you want to just start a different meeting?
**Matthew Bryce:** Because I feel like.
**Matthew Bryce:** Do you think the notes taker will send?

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm gonna.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm gonna email you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** New Google Meet.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, Perfect.

**Alex Ciereszko:** All right.
