## Transcript

**Jonathan Kluger:** Hello?

**Alexis Elliott:** Hey, Jonathan, how are you?

**Jonathan Kluger:** Sorry, I have been on back to back so like the last six hours and my CEO just texted me and I want to make sure nothing terrible is happening.

**Alexis Elliott:** That's okay.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Nope, I think he's in Hawaii and he had an extra beer and now he just wants to talk about silly stuff.

**Alexis Elliott:** I feel like when I looked at your call, it said that we were waiting for two people.
**Alexis Elliott:** Is that correct?

**Jonathan Kluger:** I think it might have automatically added my note taker and that might be what is causing the confusion.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay, let me just double check.
**Alexis Elliott:** I think when you filled something out, bear with me.
**Alexis Elliott:** You stated that your business partner or team will need to be present.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Let me see if he's free because, I mean, I can have my initial conversation.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I always loop him in because everything is a bit hectic right now.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But yeah, let me get.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay.
**Jonathan Kluger:** He's finishing up on the other line with our lawyer and then he's going to jump in with us.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay, awesome.
**Alexis Elliott:** Perfect.
**Alexis Elliott:** Well, how come you're not in Hawaii?

**Jonathan Kluger:** Oh, he lives in.
**Jonathan Kluger:** He lives in Vegas and just texted me on Sunday and said he texted me on Sunday at 6am my time.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And I'm an early riser on the east coast.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And I literally text him back because he's never awake before 6, 7am his time typically.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And I was like, are you just getting back from the casino or are you like, what is going on?
**Jonathan Kluger:** And he literally was like, oh, no, I'm flying to Hawaii.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And I was like, would have been nice for the heads up.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And he goes, oh, I'll be on all the calls.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I'm just waking up at 5am and I'm like, I don't understand the logic in that.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I was like, if you were gonna go somewhere warmer and more relaxing, just go to like south Southern California or make the big trip and just go to Brazil.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That's where I went earlier this year.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And it's only an hour ahead of the east coast, so it's not like it's throwing off your schedule.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But teach their own.
**Jonathan Kluger:** He's love him to death.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I give him a lot of crap because he doesn't spend his money responsibly.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Personal funds.
**Jonathan Kluger:** He's not allowed to use any of the business funds for that sort of stuff.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Got it.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Yes.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Very picky in that regard.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But Alex, our other co founder, will be joining.
**Jonathan Kluger:** He is CEO.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I'm CRO.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Then Nate.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Nate is a little bit of everything.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I just call him our COO basically.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But yeah, no, we're.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We're excited.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So I can give you a little bit of a context on who we are and what I'm hoping to achieve.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So I will not be your customer, but I want you to be.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I want all of my customers to be your customer.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So I'm sure you're familiar with Audience Lab or Apollo or any of the data enrichment tools out there.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay.

**Jonathan Kluger:** We are a new proprietary technology that outperforms each and every one of them.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We sign up clients on a regular basis looking to create Google Ads, establish funnels, run all of that sort of stuff, but we don't do any of that.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We purely pull the pure intent data.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So we have the most robust intent data and data repository for intent in the market right now at the most reasonable price that is available.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We're not a $30,000 a year contract like ZoomInfo.
**Jonathan Kluger:** What I was hoping was we're launching our preferred partners network here in a couple weeks.
**Jonathan Kluger:** When we launch V2, I'm on 10 to 15 calls a day.
**Jonathan Kluger:** The biggest challenge I get from people is I don't have creatives, I don't know how to make creatives.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I don't know how to establish a marketing funnel.
**Jonathan Kluger:** You guys are giving me the data.
**Jonathan Kluger:** What do I do with this data now?
**Jonathan Kluger:** Yeah, we have an integration into meta.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We have an integration in Google.
**Jonathan Kluger:** TikTok goes live soon as well.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Yeah, we have all of that capacity to be able to do that.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But at the same time, we don't want to get into that business.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We want to focus on the data and we want to find our preferred partner network who we can essentially refer all of this business to.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay.

**Jonathan Kluger:** What we're hoping for, my research, I'll be very blunt because this is how I operate.

**Alexis Elliott:** Yep.

**Jonathan Kluger:** I know you guys have cold outreach.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I know you guys do targeted ads.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I know you guys offer all of those services and all of those services require accurate intent data and accurate data when it comes to the outreach itself.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay.

**Jonathan Kluger:** The suggestion that I given my CEO and that I wanted to discuss was the possibility of you being listed as our preferred partner when it comes to added services where we just literally feed you leads that are lay up because they're going to be excited with the intent data that we have because just for reference, we spent $50 in ads using our own intent data and we booked 100 meetings.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay.

**Jonathan Kluger:** We have to turn off our ads on day two each week because two weeks ahead gets filled.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So we are going to have endless potential clients.
**Jonathan Kluger:** What we're hoping to do is we're hoping to feed the data ARM for your business while feeding you leads as well.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay, so we have a whole platform that we would be licensing where you guys could even white label it and resell it as added service or added tool to your clients for reference.
**Jonathan Kluger:** The baseline pricing that we'll have listed on our website, which is different than what we do for our white label partners.
**Jonathan Kluger:** As of when V2 goes live, February 15th will be listed at $1,000 a month.
**Jonathan Kluger:** In terms of the data tool itself, the white label package comes in the first 10 packages.
**Jonathan Kluger:** The first 10 licenses are about $300 to you.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Everything after that's a hundred bucks.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That's a month, month to month.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So what we want to do is do a strategic partnership where we're feeding you leads and agencies and groups that need help when it comes to creatives targeting.
**Jonathan Kluger:** All of the things to do with the data on the idea of we train you on the platform, you become one of our tooling partners, we become a tooling partner, let's say of yours.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And we essentially just work as a combined effort, but not having to look at the liability or the lift to one or the other.

**Alexis Elliott:** Yeah.

**Jonathan Kluger:** So I run strategic partnerships at multibillion dollar AI companies.
**Jonathan Kluger:** This is where I used to get my the bread and my bread and butter, which was, hey, your tool plugs into our workflow.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Our workflow requires your services.
**Jonathan Kluger:** How do we create a relationship that can be mutually beneficial?

**Alexis Elliott:** Right, so it sounds like you're looking for white labeling.
**Alexis Elliott:** Correct.

**Jonathan Kluger:** We would white label to you guys so you could brand it yourself brand.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But then we would also want to send you leads.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Every time I get someone that says I need help, I don't have creative, I don't know what I'm doing.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I keep signing clients and I just want to be able to then turn around and turn to someone else and say, hey, provide me these creatives, then I'll go and deliver this.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Or I know some people who are just like, I've never done ads, I've never done socials.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I need help.
**Jonathan Kluger:** What can I do?
**Jonathan Kluger:** Well, you can post an ad and target the wrong audience and be turned off of Google Ads, meta ads, everything for the rest of your career.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So we always like to say is leveraging our data with the correct creative is going to lead to.
**Jonathan Kluger:** For instance, one of my clients today said we pay a third of the price for a lead.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Now when we see three times higher conversions throughout a 12.6 conversion rate on their ads right now on meta just by the intent targeting that they're doing.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay, so I just want to be transparent back.
**Alexis Elliott:** So a lot of people ask us to do this and it's not something that we technically do, but just to give you the straightforward answer, because I just asked the team once more because we do get this often and sometimes, I don't know, I always like to re ask.
**Alexis Elliott:** So it is a 3K initiation fee.
**Alexis Elliott:** That's the setup of all the systems, the processes, the boarding forms, the tagging, all that stuff.
**Alexis Elliott:** And then we get a 15% of whatever their clients pay us.

**Jonathan Kluger:** So what you're saying is for what we pay to you guys is we pay you three grand to initially get it set up and then it's 15% of the revenue that you refer to us.

**Alexis Elliott:** 15% of everything.
**Alexis Elliott:** Their clients buy from us.
**Alexis Elliott:** Your clients buy from us.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Oh, okay.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I understand.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So what we're.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Because what we wanted to do is we know that you use a data, a data tool of some sort or an intent tool of some sort.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Right now we assume based off of your targeting and your ad offering, we just wanted to offer the tool to you guys at a specialty discount so you can just sell it to your clients and make all the money you want off of it.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We don't expect anything back.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We just want to work with an agency and be able to have more volume through a single client.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That can then give us a better feedback loop.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Transparently.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We've literally.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Our biggest competitor is Audience Lab.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Currently we transition up to three clients a day from them because our data is not only more superior in terms of quality, it's also cheaper that we are able to operate at.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So what I was hoping to do was just have you guys, we offer it to you guys.
**Jonathan Kluger:** You want to do a head by head test, you want to talk into a little more deep discussion and what your current workflows look like.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And we're selling each license to you for $100, which is relative value is $1200.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We're letting you do whatever you want with it.
**Jonathan Kluger:** You can sell it for 500, you can sell it for 100, you can sell it for 2000.
**Jonathan Kluger:** It's whatever.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So we want to refer people to you.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We don't necessarily ask for a kickback.
**Jonathan Kluger:** It's nice.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We love that it's more so.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So we can focus on the data.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Both of my co founders had six figure marketing companies that they turned down because we're focusing on growing this into a half a billion dollar business.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay, does that make a little more sense?

**Alexis Elliott:** Yeah, it just.
**Alexis Elliott:** I'm trying to translate this to the team because this is a very one off call that I get.
**Alexis Elliott:** And give me a second because Jason is kind of not popping on, but he's going to respond to this for you.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Yeah, you're totally fine.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And if you need more information, all that I know this isn't.
**Jonathan Kluger:** This was honestly me walking my dog this morning.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I got an ad from you guys and I literally went, oh, ooh, I would love to be able to refer them business.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And then they use our tool.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I was like, I've been looking for people like this because I literally had three calls today who was like, so what's a good creative to use on meta ads?
**Jonathan Kluger:** And I'm like, all right, let me explain to you what Andromeda AI is.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Let me explain to you how to break down how to make ads and all of that fun stuff.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Here's one of my co founders, Alex, not sure if he's done with the lawyer or not.
**Jonathan Kluger:** If he is, he'll unmik, but if he isn't, he'll pause.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So that's what he just texted me.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay.
**Alexis Elliott:** So bear with me.

**Jonathan Kluger:** You're totally fine.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay.
**Alexis Elliott:** Just to repeat the deck.
**Alexis Elliott:** So it's a 3K initiation fee and then you guys get 15% of everything their clients buy from us.
**Alexis Elliott:** Yeah, you were.
**Alexis Elliott:** That sounds good.
**Alexis Elliott:** That's.
**Alexis Elliott:** That's like literally the offer.

**Jonathan Kluger:** It seems like that's very reasonable.
**Jonathan Kluger:** What I was just suggesting is more margin for you guys.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Like you're giving me a better deal.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I'm saying is we'll sell you the licenses at 100.
**Jonathan Kluger:** 100 bucks a license after 10, and you can just sell them for whatever.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And you don't have to tell us.
**Jonathan Kluger:** You just tell me, I need another license, I give you another license.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That's all.

**Alexis Elliott:** I don't know.
**Alexis Elliott:** This is what I'm being told.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Alex, for your reference, we're just talking about possibly partnering and having them leverage or recommend our tool.
**Jonathan Kluger:** They said it's three grand to join their preferred partner network, essentially.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Correct.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Is that.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Is that right?

**Alexis Elliott:** It's 3k for the initiation.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And then we get 15% kickback of anything that they sell the product for.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I had mentioned potentially the option of just doing a traditional white label approach, but if this is something that sounds better on your end, we can dive into it.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I mean, I definitely think that would be something we'd be open to, I imagine, if we wanted to have another conversation.
**Jonathan Kluger:** If I wanted to demo the platform for you guys and Jason too, so you have a little bit more context and then we can talk through the nitty gritty.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I'm happy to do that as well.

**Alexis Elliott:** He gave me a task.
**Alexis Elliott:** He said for you to listen to this.
**Alexis Elliott:** Ready?

**Jonathan Kluger:** All right.
**Jonathan Kluger:** It's wanted to give you this quick context on our partner program.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We have a ton of partners and here's how it works.
**Jonathan Kluger:** There is an initiation fee of 3K.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay, 3K to send us business.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That initiation fee is in place because of all the systems and processes involved in setting up an affiliate partner with a done for you service as robust as ours.
**Jonathan Kluger:** You pay a 3k initiation fee.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We set up your own onboarding form, all the processes automations, all the tracking to make sure that you get paid.
**Jonathan Kluger:** It's way different than an affiliate.
**Jonathan Kluger:** You can't do affiliates because all these projects are mostly custom.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So pay 3k one time and then every single thing that you're.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That these leads that you send to us by you get rewarded.
**Jonathan Kluger:** 15 every 30 days is paid out monthly.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay.
**Jonathan Kluger:** The reason why we do 30 days is because if someone comes on and wants to do buyer's remorse or a refund, we give 30 days of clearing power so that that can happen.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So 3k up front and then for the longevity of our partnership, you want to be a fur partner 15 of everything the clients buy and we do the dawn few services from there based on what the client buys.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That is it.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So let us know.

**Alexis Elliott:** He's also a straight shooter.

**Jonathan Kluger:** I know.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I appreciate it.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I saw him on the video.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I, I got that vibe that I think I'll take that back to the team and talk to them as well.
**Jonathan Kluger:** What we also would love the chance if he's open to it.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I'll send over a demo example.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But we think the tool could be a value where you can actually create additional value for your customers if you use it.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So we want you to be able to use our tool to be able to do better and be able to essentially say to people we can target anyone in the world who's looking for Toyota RAV4 that's shown intent to buy in the last two weeks.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Are you a car dealer now?
**Jonathan Kluger:** We target those and your ads are more effective that way.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So I think joining the network is definitely something we'd be interested in because we're always, we always look for partners to refer business to outside of our scope.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But on your full service.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We partnered.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We have what, three or four full service agencies that license our tool to use for their clients as well.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So that's where I want.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I see.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Like, hey, we can send you business.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And we can also make your business even better by sending by essentially using the tool in conjunction as well.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So if that's something you guys would be open to, on top of that, I think we would be very much open to joining the network where we get the kickback as well.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I mean.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But we also want to make sure that we show you guys this tool because we think it could be a pretty big game changer for your org, considering the costs of our competitors and the accuracy of our.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Of our platform.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So, like, just to give you a reference, I know I keep talking about it, I can just show you the screen instead.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Like, my bad.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So first things first.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We have super pixels.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We're able to provide 5 per license.
**Jonathan Kluger:** These super pixels have a 40 to 70% identification rate of website visitors without entering any personal information.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I'm sure you're familiar with the super pixel world.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Hey, John, just.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Let's just make it 10 for Alexis because I was late and I feel bad.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So she gets 10 pixels.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay, 10 super pixels per.
**Jonathan Kluger:** What we can do is those super pixels will help you identify top pages, top sources to those pages, top cities, and even give a really nice heat map.
**Jonathan Kluger:** The reason I say a really nice heat map is I'm sure not all of your clients are the most tech savvy.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Let's say they're located in Fort Worth and you zoom in all the way.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Guess what?
**Jonathan Kluger:** Maybe you should open an office in Dallas because you're getting as many website visitors in Dallas as you are in Fort Worth.
**Jonathan Kluger:** This is all good and all, but what good is this for me?
**Jonathan Kluger:** What information do I get within the visitors identification?
**Jonathan Kluger:** You can look at their user pathway.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Not only that, if I slide over, you can actually see their religion, their income, their credit rating, their contact information, device id, IP address behaviors, and even the vehicles that they own.
**Jonathan Kluger:** This can also be used to build audiences if you want to do targeting.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So this can be on a B2C or a B2B.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So like, on a B2C would be like window repair.

**Alexis Elliott:** When do you guys start this?

**Jonathan Kluger:** So our technical lead has been building out this platform and this data for the last 15 years, working directly with Fortune 100 companies.
**Jonathan Kluger:** What essentially happened was it was all an SQL query that was overly complex that no one else could use.
**Jonathan Kluger:** She ended up being able to secure a contract that is only given to less than the people I can hold up on one hand in the entire world, where we're actually tapping into the same data repositories as Fortune 100 companies that typically run a minimum of $250,000 a month.
**Jonathan Kluger:** With that, we're able to also bring in additional data sources we've established to waterfall enrich.
**Jonathan Kluger:** There's another 200 plus.
**Jonathan Kluger:** All of these data sources are able to provide us with a holistic view not only of the contact, but of their intent.
**Jonathan Kluger:** The reason that this has been so powerful is the data that we're actually able to pull is not only the SHA256, which is crucial for meta advertising, but it goes all the way into the personal and their business contact information.
**Jonathan Kluger:** What I mean by the SHA is as you can see, we have a pretty damn efficient match rate.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And this match rate is why our intent is so powerful is because every audience you build, either B2B or B2C, you actually have the ability to save it as a query.
**Jonathan Kluger:** This query that you save records here is 43,522.
**Jonathan Kluger:** You can schedule these to update automatically week to week, which drastically reduces the need for your team to be pulling constant lead lists as well as schedule when you want to send it to your ad account.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So you can literally find a niche or a query of intent data that works perfectly for a client of yours.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Just sit back, relax, and let it do its job.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Because if you find the intent category that works, you create the right piece of creative.
**Jonathan Kluger:** As I'm sure you know, that ad will continuously be efficient because you're cycling out the old intent and bringing in people that are showing it new.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That's where we view this as something that could be useful and for you guys as well.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We do have integrations, direct integrations for each of your accounts, so you can easily integrate in.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So what we want to be able to do my level as well.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That's what we use.
**Jonathan Kluger:** What we want to just be able to do is we want you guys to be basically a power partner in the sense of you leverage the tool for your own needs for your clients, you charge whatever the heck you want.
**Jonathan Kluger:** If this to you is valued at $2,000 a month and you think you can position it and sell it for it, hell yeah, go for it.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We'd love to see that, keep on keeping on.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But we also think it could just be really great to have a team of experts that are doing this every single day with numerous clients as we grow and as we expand our product.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Because the best feedback for end users is going to be the power users.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And we need to establish our preferred network that expands that power user base and we ensure that we don't sell the tool to someone who lacks knowledge and then goes out, does one test, doesn't know what they're doing, and then the test might not turn out how exactly they want.
**Jonathan Kluger:** By having power, using partners like yourselves, we'd be able to refer them.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We don't even necessarily.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I don't want to speak on Alex's behalf, but maybe we don't even need the referral fee.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We just want you guys to be using the tool, providing feedback and being able to essentially expand it to the masses.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Does that give a little more context on us and make a little bit more sense than me just talking in very broad, no visual kind of terms?

**Alexis Elliott:** Yes.
**Alexis Elliott:** This is definitely more for our backend guys that are much more involved in this space that you guys are in.
**Alexis Elliott:** But I think at the end of the day that the question just remains if it's something you want to move forward with us.
**Alexis Elliott:** This is something in regards to kind of pitching your product and us using it would be to that team.
**Alexis Elliott:** Right.
**Alexis Elliott:** Because I can't say yes or no.
**Alexis Elliott:** I'm just the person.
**Alexis Elliott:** If you want to partner with us, it's 3K.
**Alexis Elliott:** If that's a yes, you will then talk to the backend people and they'll tell you whether or not this makes sense for us to kind of utilize.

**Jonathan Kluger:** That sounds good to you?
**Jonathan Kluger:** Yeah.

**Alexis Elliott:** So however you guys want to move forward, and then we'll go from there just to be transparent back.
**Alexis Elliott:** Right.
**Alexis Elliott:** Because I think what you guys do is awesome, but I'm not going to be the one that says yes or no.
**Alexis Elliott:** It gets past me.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Jonathan Kluger:** In that case, we'd love the chance to talk with that team.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We are interested in partnering with you guys.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We just want to make sure that that team is.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That we have this.
**Jonathan Kluger:** This synergetic relationship identified.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And then if it costs.
**Jonathan Kluger:** If it costs money to initially establish that, we.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We can.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We can explore that internally.
**Jonathan Kluger:** But we're definitely interested in looking at you guys as a partnership in that regard.
**Jonathan Kluger:** 100.

**Alexis Elliott:** Cool.
**Alexis Elliott:** Alex.
**Alexis Elliott:** Nice to meet you.
**Alexis Elliott:** I'm Alexis.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Nice to meet you, Alexis.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm sorry I was a little bit late.
**Alex Ciereszko:** John threw this on my calendar and he was like, hey, if you can jump in, jump in.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I was on the other line, but I'm here now.

**Alexis Elliott:** I like it.
**Alexis Elliott:** John, he's detail also.
**Alexis Elliott:** What is.
**Alexis Elliott:** What is in the background of you?
**Alexis Elliott:** I've been dying this whole time.
**Alexis Elliott:** Curious.

**Jonathan Kluger:** The band, It's.
**Jonathan Kluger:** It's a band called Goose, and then that one's Red Clay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** You're asking him.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay, so that's red clay strays.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Who does.
**Jonathan Kluger:** They're pretty popular in the Americana space.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That's Billy Strings then.
**Jonathan Kluger:** These are all print designs from Goose.
**Jonathan Kluger:** They're called foil prints.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Hey, Google Office lights pink.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I didn't do it enough.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Hey, Google Office lights red.

**Alexis Elliott:** I can kind of get an idea.

**Jonathan Kluger:** So as light changes, they have foil reflectors built in.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So it will actually change the image.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Or when sun hits it, it will refract rainbows across the room.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So I just thought it's fun.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Little thing for my personality in the background.

**Alexis Elliott:** No, I like it.
**Alexis Elliott:** Sorry.
**Alexis Elliott:** It was the first thing I noticed when you hopped on the call and I had to ask.
**Alexis Elliott:** Cause it's just been.

**Jonathan Kluger:** I'm not.
**Jonathan Kluger:** I'm not offended.
**Jonathan Kluger:** It's a lot more exciting than I am sometimes.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So if you space out and you look in the background, at least I know you're looking at cool art and not just into nothingness.

**Alexis Elliott:** That is fair.
**Alexis Elliott:** I know.
**Alexis Elliott:** Alex is like.
**Alexis Elliott:** My background is.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Yeah, Alexis, I really.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm not.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm not allowed to keep my.
**Alex Ciereszko:** My background visible.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's a lot of firearms, so I just.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I keep it tame right here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm in Pennsylvania.

**Alexis Elliott:** Oh, okay.
**Alexis Elliott:** I was there.
**Alexis Elliott:** You in Texas?

**Jonathan Kluger:** No, I'm in North Carolina.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And I don't put mine on the wall.

**Alexis Elliott:** I'm in Los Angeles.
**Alexis Elliott:** So different.
**Alexis Elliott:** But Alex, before you kind of hopped on the call, basically.
**Alexis Elliott:** What?
**Alexis Elliott:** I had Jason kind of share a voice memo because I am just typically in sales.
**Alexis Elliott:** Right.
**Alexis Elliott:** I'm just selling kind of what we do.
**Alexis Elliott:** But it sounds like we're looking for a partnership.
**Alexis Elliott:** So Jason basically told Jonathan It's.
**Alexis Elliott:** It's 3K to initiate and to start everything.
**Alexis Elliott:** We will also offer a 15, I guess, kickback, right.
**Alexis Elliott:** From whatever your clients purchase from us.
**Alexis Elliott:** That is up to you guys, whether or not you want to utilize that.
**Alexis Elliott:** You guys can discuss this once you get further in.
**Alexis Elliott:** The initial thing with me is just deciding if you want to pay that 3K to kind of see what those next steps look like.
**Alexis Elliott:** Right.
**Alexis Elliott:** And speak to the team about using your product or just receiving that 15 and just being a white label partner.
**Alexis Elliott:** Those are kind of where we're at.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Perfect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All right, I appreciate that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Thanks for getting me up to speed.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Yeah, yeah.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So just for my clarification, do we pay the 3k before we're able to talk to the other part of the team, or are we able to do a quick demo, see their feedback, and then.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And then make that determination?
**Jonathan Kluger:** Because if.
**Jonathan Kluger:** If you Already have a data providing partner that you're already working with.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We don't.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We want to make sure that we're not necessarily kind of paying $3,000 to give a demo.
**Jonathan Kluger:** That's all.

**Alexis Elliott:** Sorry, Let me.
**Alexis Elliott:** Is your website the best?
**Alexis Elliott:** If I just like pop it in so he could take a quick brief.

**Alex Ciereszko:** At it, it is going to be pretty solid.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay, give me one second.
**Alexis Elliott:** Have you guys always worked together and.
**Alexis Elliott:** Oh, we could use.
**Alexis Elliott:** So not guaranteeing, but we do not have a provider.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Okay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** You waiting on us, Alexis?

**Alexis Elliott:** Yeah, I'm just wondering what our thoughts are.
**Alexis Elliott:** Yeah, I mean if in this very interesting conversation I was like, this is, you know, gotta love doing sales because you never know who you're gonna get on the line.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Yeah, I'm keeping it exciting on a Tuesday.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Come on now.

**Alexis Elliott:** That is true.
**Alexis Elliott:** I feel like I should like go get a margarita and have a taco Tuesday after this.

**Jonathan Kluger:** I would right now.
**Jonathan Kluger:** If I didn't have another call in an hour, I would be have a glass of bourbon for sure.

**Alexis Elliott:** I have two more calls after this, so my day is pretty much just getting started.

**Jonathan Kluger:** So there we go.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So it's definitely something that we want to explore.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Let us circle back internally and follow up what we.
**Jonathan Kluger:** If we're even able to have a quick little chat just to see and explain the pricing or the positioning and how our other white label partners in similar situations have succeeded, there might just be an opportunity to partner on the data side where we're not looking for a kickback, we're just looking to refer a power using partner of ours.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Clients that need these services to ensure that the use of the data makes sense for them.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Because you know, you can, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't force it to drink.
**Jonathan Kluger:** At the end of the day, if someone doesn't know how to put two and two together, we can give them the best data in the world, but they're just going to end up shooting themselves in the foot.

**Alexis Elliott:** Yes.
**Alexis Elliott:** I'm not ignoring you.
**Alexis Elliott:** I'm asking if they can either send a demo or get on a quick 10 minute call.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Perfect.

**Alexis Elliott:** Kind of understand.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Are you guys currently running any advertising?

**Jonathan Kluger:** No.
**Jonathan Kluger:** So they, they have hundreds of clients that they do advertising full cycle for.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, John, I got a clip of that guy today raving about how our click through rates or their click through rates like doubled and their cost dropped by half.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We should just send them that because that's what every single client says.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So that like explains everything, Alexis.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay, so let's do this so, yes, there's someone that you'll talk with that is our CEO, but typically we take that initiation fee first.
**Alexis Elliott:** So let's do this.
**Alexis Elliott:** Send me the demo.
**Alexis Elliott:** I will get that to our CEO, he'll review it.
**Alexis Elliott:** If it looks like something that he's like, this is something that we like to partner with, then I will let you guys know.
**Alexis Elliott:** If I get kind of like a green light on their end of what they think about the demo, then you guys can decide.
**Alexis Elliott:** Okay.
**Alexis Elliott:** Do we want to pay the 3K and move forward?
**Alexis Elliott:** Then YouTube will have a meeting and the ball will get rolling.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So, Alexis, just so we're clear, we have to pay three grand to talk to him, basically.

**Alexis Elliott:** To talk to him directly?
**Alexis Elliott:** Yes.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Alexis Elliott:** Because it's.
**Alexis Elliott:** We.
**Alexis Elliott:** It's.
**Alexis Elliott:** A lot of people come to us for white labeling.
**Alexis Elliott:** So that's why.
**Alexis Elliott:** Send me the demo.
**Alexis Elliott:** Tell me what I can give to them to kind of show them.
**Alexis Elliott:** Like I said, we do not have.
**Alexis Elliott:** He says we do not have a provider.
**Alexis Elliott:** So yes, it is something that we could use.

**Jonathan Kluger:** But if you guys, let's circle up offline, we'll pull one of our.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Our good full demos, the testimonial, and then we can break down the pricing sheet for them.
**Jonathan Kluger:** We'll just send over what the pricing looks like so you guys get the idea of where your margin lives.
**Jonathan Kluger:** And if it makes sense as you guys just sell this and take as much margin as you want, if that makes sense, the partnership, or if it makes sense as a referral, and we can, we can circle up after that, if that.
**Jonathan Kluger:** If that works for you.

**Alexis Elliott:** Yeah, sounds good.
**Alexis Elliott:** I will ask them your information and then I'll circle back with you guys.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Perfect.

**Alexis Elliott:** Okay.
**Alexis Elliott:** Do you have like.
**Alexis Elliott:** Let me.
**Alexis Elliott:** What's.
**Alexis Elliott:** Phone number?
**Alexis Elliott:** Who should I text for that kind of demo?

**Jonathan Kluger:** You want me to handle it?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, John, if you could, that'd be awesome because my.
**Alex Ciereszko:** My schedule's pretty much packed the whole week.

**Alexis Elliott:** Whenever you give it to me, I'll send it right to him and he'll peek at it when he can, and then I'll let you know his thoughts.
**Alexis Elliott:** And then from there, we'll just decide on what makes sense for everybody.

**Jonathan Kluger:** Sweet.
**Jonathan Kluger:** Sounds good.
