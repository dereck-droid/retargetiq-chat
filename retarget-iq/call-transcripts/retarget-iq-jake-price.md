## Transcript

**Jake Price:** Very expensive.
**Jake Price:** Good results on B2B.

**Jon Kluger:** Right?

**Jake Price:** I'll give them that.
**Jake Price:** B2C, not so much.
**Jake Price:** Let's see.
**Jake Price:** We had a few dozen clients using the data.
**Jake Price:** Most of them did not get good results.
**Jake Price:** Returning clients, we ended up moving on.
**Jake Price:** We're now focused on one very specific niche in house.
**Jake Price:** We're doing lead generation for motor vehicle accidents, personal injury firms.
**Jake Price:** So basically the use case at this point would be twofold.
**Jake Price:** One more important at this point would be the consumer side.
**Jake Price:** Can we find consumers in those motor vehicle accidents who need representation?
**Jake Price:** Can we find them specifically like businesses happening right as they're showing any intent, you know, whatsoever for the first time, or at least, you know, threshold of intent.
**Jake Price:** And then the second would be on the B2B side, just helping us find attorneys actively looking for Legion.
**Jake Price:** Right now we just use Ocean, we download big lists, we target everybody.
**Jake Price:** Quite frankly, it's working.
**Jake Price:** So that is definitely the second most important use case for us.
**Jake Price:** If, if we don't do that like, and we can just do B2C, that's fine too.

**Jon Kluger:** That really is, you know, a couple things on that.
**Jon Kluger:** We can do both.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to your, your other list that you're getting enriched, we can do that as well too.
**Jon Kluger:** So if it needs another layer of enrichment, if you need us to pull it up as well, we can do that as well.
**Jon Kluger:** On the B2B or the B2C side, transparently we're adding additional terms on the B2 launch, which will happen in two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** So in that process, if we.
**Jon Kluger:** I know for a fact we don't have specifically auto of auto vehicle lawyers or like accident attorneys.
**Jon Kluger:** We have personal injury, we do have auto accident as intent topics, but we can add those topics for you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** You just gotta let me know, like, transparently we are focused on the V2, which is a going to be a lot sexier.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to have a lot more intent terms and it's going to have a lot more integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** So they're focused on that.
**Jon Kluger:** If you guys come aboard, I can guarantee you we will have those terms available for you.
**Jon Kluger:** I just don't want to pull them off of one project until we know that you guys are going to need it.
**Jon Kluger:** That's, that's all.

**Jake Price:** Question for you.
**Jake Price:** Just real quick, when you say terms, would we.
**Jake Price:** What exactly does that mean?

**Jon Kluger:** So I, I.
**Jon Kluger:** Intent topic is a better phrase.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm saying terms.
**Jon Kluger:** But how we typically look at intent is we look at it as a root phrase.
**Jon Kluger:** So instead of you having to put 15 different phrases of auto accident or personal injury, lawyer, personal injury.
**Jon Kluger:** But all of this like, like Audience Lab makes you do.
**Jon Kluger:** We take the core term and then that term essentially sits above the iterations beneath it of the different ones.
**Jon Kluger:** So instead of being super granular where people might choose the wrong iteration, what we've been doing is we've been trying to make it a little bit easier for them.
**Jon Kluger:** What we've seen as a result is the exact thing that you just mentioned where you want to be able to pull up that very niche exact term.
**Jon Kluger:** So in V2, you'll literally be able to put the, the exact phrase that you want searched and you'll be able to search for it.
**Jon Kluger:** What I always recommend is don't Bombard it with 15 different phrases like Audience Lab might make you have because there's too much diversity in terms of the individual people.
**Jon Kluger:** So like if someone is searching auto, auto accident, auto accident, lawyer, auto accident, unemployment insurance, whatever the different iterations that you might put in, sure.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't know what you are weighing as the most important term.
**Jon Kluger:** So when.
**Jon Kluger:** Can we go to rank the intent?
**Jon Kluger:** We don't know which like the.
**Jon Kluger:** Take a simple term, run an audience, which by the way, we have unlimited audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** So you're not here with your handcuffs where you are limited to what you can do.
**Jon Kluger:** You can literally, we say up to 10,000 audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** If you hit 10,000 audiences, email me, I'll give you another 10,000.
**Jon Kluger:** You're blowing my mind if you can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** We had a guy in our last call, he's like, I'm going to do my best to hit that number.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm just like, no, he's not.

**Jake Price:** Anyway, yeah, I mean, truthfully, we mostly would just be using it for our own purposes.
**Jake Price:** I don't anticipate more than like five audiences, really.

**Jon Kluger:** Well, if you ever want to expand out too, by the way, you can easily do it.
**Jon Kluger:** There's nothing stopping you.
**Jon Kluger:** You have unlimited saved queries as well.
**Jon Kluger:** So if there's a specific niche that you find that is working really well for you guys, you can easily save that, refresh it, and have it scheduled to refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, you guys mentioned you were spending a lot with Audience Lab with multiple clients, I assume.
**Jon Kluger:** Did they have you on the white label or were you just using a regular license with additional audience building capabilities?

**Jake Price:** Mostly what you just described there at the end.
**Jake Price:** We dabbled with white label towards the very end of it.

**Jon Kluger:** They were probably charging us, what, like 1950amonth?
**Jon Kluger:** No, no.

**Jake Price:** So we had, we had like 35 audience, something like that, custom models.
**Jake Price:** And we were paying more than that.
**Jake Price:** The key thing though is we could get up to 500,000 records per audience.
**Jake Price:** So we were never limited on.
**Jake Price:** They had two tiers of plans and we were on the plan when we had a limited number of audiences, but we could get up to 500,000 people.
**Jake Price:** The other tier, you could have unlimited audiences, but there were a cap on the total number of records.
**Jake Price:** So you basically could create big audiences.

**Jon Kluger:** So, Drake, you're going to love us.
**Jon Kluger:** There's no cap on the records, there's no cap on the audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** The only cap on the records is a million in a single query.
**Jon Kluger:** And the reason for that is your query is too broad.
**Jon Kluger:** If it's a million in the result, that's not going to work great for ads if you've got a million people that you're trying to target.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, everything that they put you in a box, I'm going to break down the wall like a, like a mime.
**Jon Kluger:** Just break it down and let you guys have fun.
**Jon Kluger:** Because that's exactly what we're designed for.
**Jon Kluger:** We were created by data engineers for marketers to be able to feel like a data engineer.
**Jon Kluger:** And the one thing they teach you in statistics is you have to always test a baseline versus a hypothesis.
**Jon Kluger:** You're stuck with four audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not like you can do a lot of tests.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, I'll take you guys to the platform for your understanding a little bit about me.
**Jon Kluger:** I've been in the AI and data space for over eight years.
**Jon Kluger:** I studied honors data analytics and graduated with a data analytics degree.
**Jon Kluger:** One of the reasons that I am leading the sales and go to market organization here at RetargetIQ is I've been on the beta testing team@Apolloio.
**Jon Kluger:** I know the CTO at Seamless because I've known them since they were a 10 person company.
**Jon Kluger:** I've known ZoomInfo before they even cracked a million dollars in revenue.
**Jon Kluger:** And the data enrichment and the outbound marketing and sales world is my expertise.
**Jon Kluger:** And I know firsthand how important it is not only to feel like you're not handcuffed to a set of bad data that you're paying out the shop for, but to be able to also test.
**Jon Kluger:** So a little bit about our platform.
**Jon Kluger:** First, I want to highlight one thing that I think is always important.
**Jon Kluger:** This is a live account.
**Jon Kluger:** So I'm not here in a demo playground where I know exactly what we need to search.
**Jon Kluger:** So when we go to Build an audience.
**Jon Kluger:** And I.
**Jon Kluger:** And I need to try a couple different phrases to make sure I pull up the right exact term.
**Jon Kluger:** That's.
**Jon Kluger:** That's exactly what your experience may be like.
**Jon Kluger:** You gotta find the exact niche that you want until E2 comes out where you can just put the term that you want exactly as is.
**Jon Kluger:** So what you'll see here, and this is our homepage, the statistics and insights that we're giving you now is based off of our super pixel.
**Jon Kluger:** So with each individual license that we provide, you are able to get five super pixels that you can place in your website, your client's website, whatever it might be.
**Jon Kluger:** Those super pixels are used to capture anonymous visitors as they land on your site.
**Jon Kluger:** This could be similar to those that same offering as like a pearl diver, but it's not as robust in terms of the analytics screen and all of that.
**Jon Kluger:** All of that will be much prettier and present in V2, which comes out February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** What you will see right off the bat, which I really like.
**Jon Kluger:** So we highlight the top pages where they're coming in from and the actual physical maps.
**Jon Kluger:** And the reason I like this is I know you're not doing as much work with clients these days directly as you mentioned, but as you zoom in, I personally am a visual person.
**Jon Kluger:** So being able to go into Atlanta and go, oh, wow, northwest, there's.
**Jon Kluger:** There's a good amount of volume there.
**Jon Kluger:** And even outside of the city, that's interesting.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe we need to have a physical.
**Jon Kluger:** If it's a physical location, like a mechanic shop, maybe we need to start exploring the possibility of putting a second location there.
**Jon Kluger:** Because we have the traffic, we have people coming to our site looking for our services, but they're not in the location that's directly closest to them.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's one of the visual elements I really enjoy about it.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, like, I always like to use Fort Worth because the Fort Worth, Dallas area is so big now.
**Jon Kluger:** You can literally look at this and go, okay, maybe I don't do more offices in Fort Worth.
**Jon Kluger:** I start shifting more east.

**Jake Price:** Sure.

**Jon Kluger:** In terms of the data that we capture, you'll see right here, we'll have associated companies.
**Jon Kluger:** This is just the.
**Jon Kluger:** The website visitor.
**Jon Kluger:** This is not nearly the full extent of the data that we have.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, if we scroll over to the right, what you'll see is you'll see the user path.
**Jon Kluger:** So assuming they have had a user journey, we'll be able to see their first, last path and the number of pages they visit.
**Jon Kluger:** Additionally, here's the fun part.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only do we have the data categories that audience lab had, it's quite extensive.
**Jon Kluger:** So you'll see income, you'll see net worth, you'll see email addresses, phone numbers, device id, all of their Internet based behavior and you can even look at their vehicle type and their properties that they own.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I always like to highlight vehicle type so I know you're dealing with auto accidents.

**Jake Price:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Is one of the topics you're looking at.
**Jon Kluger:** Well imagine someone's looking at auto accidents and then you figure out what type of vehicle they drive.
**Jon Kluger:** Then you can just target them for a brand new vehicle when their car gets totaled and you can just start selling them cars.
**Jon Kluger:** So like let's say they take their car in for auto repair and you can now or maybe they're looking for a lawyer for auto for personal injury as it relates to an auto accident now you know, oh, that person's probably going to get a payout.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe I should tell the lawyer also, hey, they were driving a Lincoln, you should see, you know, to refer them to the local Lincoln car dealership.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe your, your buddy at Lincoln will give you, you know, a Lincoln lawyer car to drive around.
**Jon Kluger:** And that was, that was not on purpose.
**Jon Kluger:** I walked myself into that.
**Jon Kluger:** You some pretty deep insights into all of this information.
**Jon Kluger:** So this is what's captured on just a quick visit.

**Jake Price:** Pause real quick.
**Jake Price:** So a few questions.
**Jake Price:** One is the age.
**Jake Price:** I see 70 flat.
**Jake Price:** Audience Lab does ranges.
**Jake Price:** They have skip traced age.
**Jake Price:** So that's the exact age there.
**Jake Price:** Okay, next one is do we have their LinkedIn by chance?

**Jon Kluger:** For some of them, yes.
**Jon Kluger:** If you do B2B the LinkedIn is a lot more prominent.
**Jon Kluger:** If you do B2C LinkedIn is less prevalent.
**Jon Kluger:** And just simply the reason for that is when we do the B2B intent searches, we're looking for people in the context of their employment.
**Jon Kluger:** And if we're looking at context of their employment, we need to confirm who they're employed by, which is why we go and we essentially confirm on LinkedIn.

**Jake Price:** Okay, so if we do B2B we'll have some of them.
**Jake Price:** And can you open up that side screen again with all the data?
**Jake Price:** Yeah, of course the LinkedIn would be in this screen right here.

**Jon Kluger:** So the LinkedIn is going to show up in an audience building result.
**Jon Kluger:** If you were to export this into a CSV the LinkedIn would be prevalent.
**Jon Kluger:** But it varies on person to person.
**Jon Kluger:** Sometimes people don't have a LinkedIn, sometimes they do.
**Jon Kluger:** And I just mean that as in like not we don't have it Data wise, like, I have friends who literally never built a LinkedIn before and it blows my mind.

**Jake Price:** But if they have LinkedIn, you're saying we download this, it'll be there.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Jake Price:** Does V2 that's coming out, will it have at some point any sort of API?

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, we already have the API.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** More specifically, could we somehow plug in and extract information from them to add it to a lead payload that we send?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we just ask you not to make more than 3,000 calls in a second.

**Jake Price:** Yeah, if we're making 3,000 calls a second, we're making billions of dollars.
**Jake Price:** I think we'll be okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Trust me.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what I'm saying is that's.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what we've almost.
**Jon Kluger:** I think we determined that was close to our limitation at this point.
**Jon Kluger:** So if, if you're making 3, 000 in a second, please make it 2, 9, 9 9.

**Jake Price:** Yeah, no, yeah, that would.
**Jake Price:** Those.
**Jake Price:** That would give us almost $900 million of revenue a day.
**Jake Price:** So I think we're.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, I'll drop this.
**Jon Kluger:** It's.
**Jon Kluger:** You can find this document at the bottom of our website.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll drop it in the chat too, in case you guys want to take a look at it.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're gonna start building something out, ignore the.
**Jon Kluger:** The V1.
**Jon Kluger:** I would probably recommend you take a look at V2, because V2 will be out in 2 and a half weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** In the interim, if you wanted to build out v1, feel free.
**Jon Kluger:** I just mean as in for your own personal lift.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to start with a regular package and then opt into the API month two, let's say I can always price it out that way so you guys don't get charged while you're not.
**Jon Kluger:** While you're building that essentially.

**Taulant Dauti:** Okay, I asked something, John, you showed on the first page on the dashboard there.
**Taulant Dauti:** Okay, so this contact here, if you scroll down, I thought I saw some other interests or intents.

**Jon Kluger:** Behaviors.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, behaviors.

**Taulant Dauti:** So this is what.
**Taulant Dauti:** This is all of the.
**Taulant Dauti:** What does this mean?

**Jon Kluger:** This is over the span of likely the last week or two.

**Taulant Dauti:** Oh, they're in market for this.
**Taulant Dauti:** These kind of things, or they've researched.

**Jon Kluger:** Browsing the items they've been looking at, the different things they've been interacting with.
**Jon Kluger:** This is why our consumer level data is so strong.
**Jon Kluger:** What I will tell you right now is zooming for Apollo Seamless and Audience Lab all use five by five as their core data set.
**Jon Kluger:** Contrary to the.
**Jon Kluger:** What.

**Jake Price:** What's.
**Jake Price:** What's 555.

**Jon Kluger:** 555 is a.
**Jon Kluger:** It's a data dealer.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** Are they Coredge Data?

**Jon Kluger:** Basically, yes, we are one of, I think two people in the entire world that has access to the data that we use.
**Jon Kluger:** I can't name our data provider because it's in the contract because they don't want people to know that we're using it because it cost about $250,000 a month.
**Jon Kluger:** Just get your foot in the door to even touch the platform, the data set.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's where we're different and why we have honestly better results.
**Jon Kluger:** We just had.
**Jon Kluger:** I was just on a call with someone where.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me see what exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't.
**Jon Kluger:** The craziness that we say we have reduced their cost on ads for one of our clients in a week by.
**Jon Kluger:** It's 50% the cost and it's three times higher conversion rates.

**Jake Price:** Okay, question.
**Jake Price:** You don't have to name the provider.
**Jake Price:** You don't have to do any of that.
**Jake Price:** I'm not asking that.
**Jake Price:** Coredge Data.
**Jake Price:** I understand.
**Jake Price:** People fill out forms.
**Jake Price:** Audience Lab says, okay, this guy filled out a form for, you know, motor vehicle accident.
**Jake Price:** Attorney.
**Jake Price:** Attorney.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Jake Price:** He's in the market.
**Jake Price:** What is, at least at a high level, the mechanism.
**Jake Price:** So if you're not poe reg, what's kind of the mechanism for you to say, this guy right here is looking at Macy's and Instagram and Boston Market.

**Jon Kluger:** We have over 200 data lakes that we tap into.
**Jon Kluger:** We have a core data lake that is leveraged by Fortune 100 companies, the one that I initially mentioned.
**Jon Kluger:** Then we have additional data lakes that are provided by intent based data providers, be it someone who literally got a deal with Macy's to put a pixel on their site to see who's going on their site and who's clicking around and doing what.

**Jake Price:** So, okay, sorry, I'm gonna ask a lot of questions.
**Jake Price:** So putting a pixel on Macy's.
**Jake Price:** That part I understand, right.
**Jake Price:** They see who's there.
**Jake Price:** Great.
**Jake Price:** It's just like a.
**Jake Price:** Basically a super pixel.
**Jake Price:** So they can do identity resolution on Macy's dot com.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**Jake Price:** Data lake.
**Jake Price:** Excuse my ignorance.
**Jake Price:** What does that mean?
**Jake Price:** How does it work?

**Jon Kluger:** Think of a data lake as just where you put all of your data and then you use SQL to call from it.
**Jon Kluger:** So a data lake is like a data set, but it's just meant to be massive.

**Jake Price:** Okay, so you've got.
**Jake Price:** It sends multiple data lakes.

**Jon Kluger:** You're saying, well, we have one core data lake that has something called waterfall enrichment.
**Jon Kluger:** What that means is imagine a lake is at the bottom of a waterfall.
**Jon Kluger:** The waterfall comes in and fills the lake.
**Jon Kluger:** So anywhere that there's a gap, the waterfall is coming in and filling those gaps.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** And then that leads to two more questions.
**Jake Price:** So it fills those gaps.
**Jake Price:** You're saying that if we have data points A, B and C about a person, but then more data is continuing to flow in and we get points D, E and F, those will eventually populate to that person.

**Jon Kluger:** Yes, it's more so is it's like our core data set might have a third of the intent topics or the intent instances.
**Jon Kluger:** And then the additional data that's waterfalled in is just matching that record with the records that they have from their data to that more complete picture of the person.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** And then the final question for now is data lakes.
**Jake Price:** So I understand this idea.
**Jake Price:** They've got a waterfall of data coming in.
**Jake Price:** So you're basically saying these data lakes are partnering with website.
**Jake Price:** How do they get the data coming into the lake?

**Jon Kluger:** It vary transparently?
**Jon Kluger:** It varies.
**Jon Kluger:** Publisher to publisher or provider.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me, Provider to provider.
**Jon Kluger:** Some of them is you're filling out surveys, some of them you're you enabled cookies on a website and it's following you around.

**Jake Price:** Some of them it's a marketing mechanism basically.
**Jake Price:** And it sounds like for the bigger ones probably several different mechanisms.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, got it.

**Jake Price:** All right, continue.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** And yeah, again please feel free if anything else comes up.

**Jake Price:** Not shy, don't worry.

**Jon Kluger:** I couldn't tell what you can see here.
**Jon Kluger:** This is kind of where we're at for the Super Pixel.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing to highlight, no cap on the number of records.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to take a Super Pixel and put it on your competitor's website, that's something that we're releasing with V2 will have record caps in terms or it will be.
**Jon Kluger:** We're figuring out the pricing mechanism because transparently the challenge that we have is let's say you're a financial advisor.
**Jon Kluger:** You could put your competitor pixel on fidelity.com or you could put it on a local financial advisor.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't think it's logical to say each pixel in that instance costs the same because the Fidelity one is going to capture millions of people while those small guy would capture a smaller number.

**Jake Price:** Sorry, how do you get a pixel on fidelity.com they're not going to let you do that.
**Jake Price:** So what's the mechanism for that?

**Jon Kluger:** Honestly, if I'm being transparent, that is my tech team and they figured out a way to do it that's legal.
**Jon Kluger:** And I just was like are we sure?
**Jon Kluger:** And then the lawyer came in and said yeah, that's okay.
**Jon Kluger:** So I, I didn't ask questions because I figured it would just confuse me.
**Jon Kluger:** But I think it's got something to do with cookie permissions from one website transferring to another.
**Jon Kluger:** So if they had, say, enable the cookie on an external website, it's another way of being able to identify them as they land.
**Jon Kluger:** But I can always double check.
**Jon Kluger:** I, I transparently, I found this out last night.

**Taulant Dauti:** Very nice lawyer.

**Jake Price:** Yeah, yeah, because I'll be transparent.
**Jake Price:** We'd have to ask our lawyer too, because that's.
**Jake Price:** I'm sure it is legal.
**Jake Price:** It does not sound legal, as.

**Jon Kluger:** It'S totally up to you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** This is going to be something that we do on an individual basis.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not like we're going to be going across the Internet and dropping them out there and just like, being like.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, I don't know how else to put it.

**Jake Price:** You guys be open to expl.
**Jake Price:** Your tech team, will they be open to explaining it to us?

**Jon Kluger:** You know, even if it's just a.

**Jake Price:** Few sentences of how it works?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we're.
**Jon Kluger:** Gonna.
**Jon Kluger:** So when V2 comes out, I'm gonna have more documentation on it too, because transparently, I'm one of the more technically inclined.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm the head of our sales team.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I'm ahead of our sales team is I'm technically inclined as well.
**Jon Kluger:** And even I was kind of like, I need a little bit of a clearer explanation here.

**Jake Price:** Yeah, okay, fine.

**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** So a couple other things to highlight is before we build the audience, I always want to mention we do have the ability to do direct mail.
**Jon Kluger:** So you upload a front a back the list, or you can actually do it based off of a campaign trigger.
**Jon Kluger:** So if someone lands on a certain webpage, be it yours or your clients, you can actually have them automatically set up to receive mail directly from through the platform.
**Jon Kluger:** The typical cost for that is about 90 cents a send, including postage.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have another partner that you're doing this with already or it's not something that you're interested in, that's fine.
**Jon Kluger:** You can come back to it whenever you want.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't make it disappear, you're good to go.
**Jon Kluger:** So this is just direct mail to the.

**Jake Price:** Anywhere in the US Or US?

**Jon Kluger:** Yes.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, great.
**Jon Kluger:** In terms of integrations, this is where we live right now.
**Jon Kluger:** You've got HubSpot, go high level Meta, Google Ads, Klaviyo, Salesforce, fresh sales, Zoho, Mailchimp, Beehive, Pipedrive, Slack, and another HubSpot.
**Jon Kluger:** As you can see, with this HubSpot, one it says create, slash, update.
**Jon Kluger:** So you do have the ability, if you're leveraging HubSpot, just to connect it in and update your existing contacts.

**Jake Price:** Focus on GHL real quick because that's what we're using.

**Jon Kluger:** So you can easily push your data over or bring your data into enrich it.
**Jon Kluger:** In terms of these integrations, they're going to be a lot more robust, custom, and have a lot more maneuverability too as well.
**Jon Kluger:** Sure.
**Jon Kluger:** We've been taking a.
**Jon Kluger:** We want to just launch a brand new working platform once instead of changing the look of it like four separate times.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's why we have a bunch of these upgrades that are rolling out all at once.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** Are you going to have LinkedIn ads and TikTok ads?

**Jon Kluger:** That's something that I have requested.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're looking to have that added as well.

**Jake Price:** Yes, have Google already.
**Jake Price:** Okay, got it.

**Jon Kluger:** In terms of building an audience.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we'll go.
**Jon Kluger:** The first thing I like to show is, as I mentioned, so let's look at this stretch here from yesterday to yesterday.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll see.
**Jon Kluger:** What is that?
**Jon Kluger:** 3.5 million records.

**Jake Price:** Sorry, this is updating multiple times a day for the same audience.

**Jon Kluger:** No, these are just individual audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** These, each of these are an individual audience.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm just trying to highlight is unlimited audiences, unlimited records.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to save a query to easily refresh, you can just save your results as a query.
**Jon Kluger:** Have it either scheduled to refresh automatically or even schedule it to send to your ad account when these queries.

**Jake Price:** That would be if we didn't actually create the audience.

**Jon Kluger:** So when we go in and create the audience, that's where we pull the query from.
**Jon Kluger:** That's where it initiates.
**Jon Kluger:** So what you'll see first here is advanced search.
**Jon Kluger:** Think of this as a LinkedIn Boolean.
**Jon Kluger:** That's it.
**Jon Kluger:** No intent, no nothing.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to just look at it at a very high level and say I want to find everyone who's a CEO of an insurance company in the United states with over $10 million in revenue.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what you would use this for.
**Jon Kluger:** Got it.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Intent B to C is as we mentioned, exactly what it sounds like.
**Jon Kluger:** Consumer focused items.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing I like to highlight here.

**Taulant Dauti:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Is as you can see, we only go back two weeks in intent data.

**Jake Price:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Reason for that, after two weeks, your buying cycle is typically over.
**Jon Kluger:** So transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** That's why that's there.
**Jon Kluger:** That's fine.
**Jon Kluger:** Now we go in new auto accident.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say we would choose a specific location.
**Jon Kluger:** You guys have a State?

**Jake Price:** Arizona.

**Jon Kluger:** Arizona.
**Jon Kluger:** Is that where y' all are based out of?

**Jake Price:** No, we do nationwide, but Arizona's a big Arkansas.
**Jake Price:** Go A.

**Jon Kluger:** You're right, sorry.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** And then if there's any other rules you want to add, here are some of the other categories we can do.
**Jon Kluger:** Children.
**Jon Kluger:** If they don't have children, their net worth, their income.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** All right.

**Jon Kluger:** And then all you would have to do is hit build audience.
**Jon Kluger:** Now it says 15 to 20 minutes.
**Jon Kluger:** This is.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm being transparent.
**Jon Kluger:** Check your phone, text someone back, go look at an email, and then just come back and simply hit refresh.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** Now the audience at this point is ready.

**Jon Kluger:** So you have 76,204 in Arizona that have had the topic of auto accident.
**Jon Kluger:** Legal, whatever it might be.

**Jake Price:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** We just wanted to kind of idiot proof it.

**Jake Price:** Sure.

**Jon Kluger:** Have people go in there and be like, why can't I find more than XYZ number of people?
**Jon Kluger:** It's like, well, when you search gray Nike Air Force Ones 2006, I don't know how many people are searching that phrase, but like, I know that's the exact item you're selling, but that's not how ads work or that's how discovery works.
**Jon Kluger:** You have to be logical in that sense.
**Jon Kluger:** So on the left side here, you'll see the personal information.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Go over to the right.
**Jon Kluger:** This is where we capture some more of the business information.
**Jon Kluger:** Since we did B2C, as I mentioned, LinkedIn isn't as present, but what is present is if we were to export it, the SHA256, we are crazy good at pulling and identifying that.
**Jon Kluger:** We do it over like a 95% rate.

**Jake Price:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** So when it comes to meta ads and being able to target.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, incredibly useful.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we captured multiple emails and multiple phone numbers.
**Jon Kluger:** With that being said, when we talk about phone numbers.

**Jake Price:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm not one to say don't cold call, but as someone who used to spend 300 people a day, no one answers.

**Jake Price:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** It'S good.

**Jake Price:** But like, we don't even need to talk about this.
**Jake Price:** It's illegal to cold call consumer accident victims.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, I didn't know that.
**Jon Kluger:** Interesting.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, you can see income range as well and network.

**Jake Price:** A lot of noise coming from your end.
**Jake Price:** Yeah, okay.
**Jake Price:** Sorry about that.
**Jake Price:** Go ahead.

**Jon Kluger:** You can just see income and net worth as well.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to filter this to only filter for people who might be high worth, making a certain bit of money where they can, they can afford your legal services, if it's a premium auto auto accident attorney or maybe they're broke.
**Jon Kluger:** And you want to target people that aren't making a lot of money.

**Jake Price:** These are.
**Jake Price:** What's the Highest income threshold?

**Jon Kluger:** 250,000 plus.

**Jake Price:** Got it.
**Jake Price:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** And then for net worth, it's more than a million.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** I saw on the visitor ID that there was somebody with income.
**Jake Price:** It was like 250 to 300 or something like that.
**Jake Price:** I thought I saw.
**Jake Price:** Is it different there or did I.
**Jake Price:** Maybe I missed.

**Jon Kluger:** That was probably net worth.

**Jake Price:** Oh, okay.
**Jake Price:** I might have missed some.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Because on net worth, I believe we have a 250 to 375 threshold.
**Jon Kluger:** If I have 150 to 249, then 240 and 250 to.
**Jon Kluger:** I think it's 375.

**Taulant Dauti:** Sure.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So then let's say you like this.
**Jon Kluger:** You're super happy.
**Jon Kluger:** You're like, all right, we want to run ads or we want to save these guys.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, download all.
**Jon Kluger:** You say auto accident, Az sure, hit save.
**Jon Kluger:** Pulling the records for download will take a little bit.
**Jon Kluger:** Couple minutes there.
**Jon Kluger:** But what you can do in the interim is you can schedule.
**Jon Kluger:** You can send it to an ad account, or you can schedule to send it to the ad account.
**Jon Kluger:** As I was highlighting before.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you wanted to refresh this list.
**Jon Kluger:** Every Sunday morning, schedule to ad account.
**Jon Kluger:** Sunday afternoon, just push it on over.
**Jon Kluger:** So that way, if you find a list or an audience or query, however you want to classify it, that works for you.
**Jon Kluger:** Now it's just a matter of rinse, repeat, sit back, and print the cache.

**Jake Price:** We can refresh it every day?

**Jon Kluger:** Every day, every minute, every hour, whatever you're feeling.

**Jake Price:** Does data come in every minute or hour?

**Jon Kluger:** I typically just tell people to do it every day because true intent isn't going to really.
**Jon Kluger:** It's really hard for us to do minute by minute.
**Jon Kluger:** I always like to say you can.
**Jon Kluger:** And maybe someone else might pop up as they cross that threshold and the timing just so happened to be right.
**Jon Kluger:** But usually I say every day.
**Jon Kluger:** You can do it one in the morning, one in the evening.
**Jon Kluger:** When you wake up the next day, do it as well.
**Jon Kluger:** But daily is usually your best plan.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Jake Price:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Then once you do that, it's usually pretty simple.
**Jon Kluger:** Beyond that, pricing wise, if you wanted to include the API access, you would be at 749 quarterly per month.
**Jon Kluger:** It's 749 per month for a quarterly agreement.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you commit to do it in quarter with us, we can provide you with the 749 price.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to do it On a month to month it's at 1047 with the API.
**Jon Kluger:** A nice thing to highlight is we do have Klarena and the math itself is you save $300 difference between monthly and quarterly.
**Jon Kluger:** I think the Klarina fee is like 40 bucks per month.
**Jon Kluger:** So you'd still technically pay monthly, but say 260 bucks if you went to Klarena instead of just paying the full amount yourself.

**Jake Price:** Okay, that's fine.
**Jake Price:** So it's 2150 for the quarter.
**Jake Price:** Okay, fine.
**Jake Price:** And then API access is 297amonth for regular.

**Jon Kluger:** For quarterly it drops down to 247 or 249.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me.

**Jake Price:** Okay, so we'd basically be three grand for the quarter if we were to do a quarterly pricing with API access.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh no, no, the one down here, this is with API built in.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, API.
**Jon Kluger:** It's only 500 bucks then I had API.

**Jake Price:** Oh, I didn't see what the hell you were doing.
**Jake Price:** Okay, you were checking something.
**Jake Price:** God, it got it.
**Jake Price:** You added API.
**Jake Price:** And then what's White Glove service?
**Jake Price:** What is that?

**Jon Kluger:** You don't need it.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't need it.
**Jon Kluger:** You're an intelligent dude who knows how to use tech.
**Jon Kluger:** That's literally someone will jump on calls with you.
**Jon Kluger:** What you really need to do is we'll set up a Slack channel for you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have a challenge to send, take a loom video or just take a screen recording, send it into the channel.
**Jon Kluger:** Say I need help within 24 7, within 24 hours.
**Jon Kluger:** We guarantee that someone will be there to help.

**Jake Price:** Got it.
**Jake Price:** That's fine.
**Jake Price:** And then a number of like, what's a license?
**Jake Price:** Is that like a seat in the platform?

**Jon Kluger:** No, that's instances.
**Jon Kluger:** So you're good with one.

**Jake Price:** Got it.
**Jake Price:** So if we had clients, that would be what that was for?

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**Jake Price:** Okay, got it.

**Jon Kluger:** And then if you do want to go to the White Glove route, just to give you the high level overview, you don't, I'm not going to sell you on it because I know it's not a need for you.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now.
**Jon Kluger:** API is included for all 10 week license.
**Jon Kluger:** Each license is only 100 bucks.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you think about it, the single license today is currently we're advertising at 500amonth.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, right.
**Jon Kluger:** At the $4,000, which is the highest threshold that white label is, you're essentially able to give each of your clients a thousand dollars worth of, of Access Software Attack.
**Jon Kluger:** Because the API is included for 100 bucks or technically it's 400 until the 11th.
**Jon Kluger:** And then it's 100.

**Taulant Dauti:** Sure.

**Jon Kluger:** So there's really nice margin baked in there, too.
**Jon Kluger:** And when D2 comes out February 15, the pricing on our website is going up.
**Jon Kluger:** If you guys sign quarterly, you're grandfathered in.
**Jon Kluger:** Just to let you know.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can be at that 500 or the 749.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're doing API in perpetuity, we're not going to raise the price on you.

**Jake Price:** So if we sign up before 15 February for the.

**Jon Kluger:** Technically, the end of this week, I have this offer for the quarterly.

**Jake Price:** Got it.
**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** So we sign up by January 30th month.

**Jon Kluger:** You don't have to worry about this.
**Jon Kluger:** You're like one of those people that used to have the Verizon plan at 20 bucks a month and they never wanted to switch off Verizon.

**Jake Price:** Sure.
**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** And that would be again, for the 749 per month on a quarterly plan.
**Jake Price:** Do we know what the price increases are going to be for V2?

**Jon Kluger:** At least.
**Jon Kluger:** least we're going to start the quarterly at 750.
**Jon Kluger:** If not 999.

**Jake Price:** Well, 750.
**Jake Price:** Oh, you're saying without API access.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me help you.
**Jon Kluger:** I got you.

**Jake Price:** Got it.
**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** So quarterly would be 750 or potentially double up to nine.
**Jake Price:** Okay, got it.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Jake Price:** Tao, do you have other questions for now?

**Taulant Dauti:** No other questions.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** And then, John, if we were to do a quarterly plan at the 500 price point, we.
**Jake Price:** You said something about we could add API access later when we're ready.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, just let me know.

**Jake Price:** And so let's say we pay the 1500 bucks.

**Taulant Dauti:** What.

**Jake Price:** How would the API pricing factor in at that point?

**Jon Kluger:** We use a stripe link.
**Jon Kluger:** You tell me.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say you get past month one.

**Jake Price:** Sure.

**Jon Kluger:** And you go, let's roll out API in month two.
**Jon Kluger:** John, I send you a link to pay 500 bucks for those two months.
**Jon Kluger:** And then when the cycle ends, that first initial billing cycle, since we'll prorate it for you, the 500 is the 250 for both months, just to be clear.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** It will just start being the 2250 number, right?
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** 750 times three is 2250.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** It would just be you getting charged 22.50 for the quarter, per quarter, every quarter.
**Jon Kluger:** You would just renew.

**Jake Price:** Got it.
**Jake Price:** And then I see API is up there.
**Jake Price:** 297.
**Jake Price:** Where did we get 250 from?
**Jake Price:** It's when you.

**Jon Kluger:** You just get the discount for paying for three months.
**Jon Kluger:** And then here's a kicker.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** If you really are happy After a quarter and you want to switch to annual, the API cost drops even more.
**Jon Kluger:** Just like 200 bucks instead of 250.
**Jon Kluger:** And the overall price of the license drops down another 93 bucks.
**Jon Kluger:** So after the first quarter, if you go, john, I'm super happy.
**Jon Kluger:** I want to work with you guys the rest of the year.
**Jon Kluger:** You're willing to pay, I believe it's a quick math be five grand plus 200.
**Jon Kluger:** So it'd be 72.7400 for the annual agreement with the API.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so we could start at the.

**Jake Price:** 1500 and then you would give us the prorated two when you're ready.
**Jake Price:** Prorated 250amonth for the rest of the quarter.
**Jake Price:** And then if we were to lock.

**Jon Kluger:** In this week, it would stay at.

**Jake Price:** That 750 per month on a quarterly.

**Jon Kluger:** Forever.
**Jon Kluger:** Forever.
**Jon Kluger:** Unless you guys say, we want to do annual, and then I can get you down even more.

**Jake Price:** And what if we upgraded to annual three, four months from now?

**Jon Kluger:** What happens then?

**Jake Price:** Do we still get this pricing, or would it be the pricing that's released by the end of the week?

**Jon Kluger:** Because I like you, I'll just keep you this pricing.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, make sense for you to switch to an annual and then pay more.
**Jon Kluger:** That would be the silliest thing I could.
**Jon Kluger:** I could position it as.

**Jake Price:** You know, we loved the concept of Audience Lab, but the truth is, we hate them.
**Jake Price:** I'll be very blunt.
**Jake Price:** The good news is you've solved a lot of the reasons why.

**Jon Kluger:** You want a kicker, Jake?
**Jon Kluger:** We are actively terrorizing the CEO of Audience Lab.
**Jon Kluger:** He is literally going into our.
**Jon Kluger:** He is so upset that we are doing better than him, providing better data, and his customers are switching at a rate of one to three a day to our platform.
**Jon Kluger:** He's going into every single one of our ads and commenting on them, saying they buy our data.
**Jon Kluger:** Their data is trash.
**Jon Kluger:** And we literally went, you just said we're buying your data and our data sucks.
**Jon Kluger:** Are you saying your data sucks?
**Jon Kluger:** Are you lying that we're buying your data?
**Jon Kluger:** Either way, both are lies.
**Jon Kluger:** So, like, we understand your frustration.
**Jon Kluger:** You are not alone.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, he is.
**Jon Kluger:** How they do business over there, we don't appreciate like.
**Jon Kluger:** And we don't think they're treating their clients correctly.

**Jake Price:** I'll be very blunt.
**Jake Price:** We've been promised they'd have a Google integration for the better part of nine months, and they don't have it yet.
**Jake Price:** That does beg the question.
**Jake Price:** So one thing with them that we just despise is they continually roll out new functionality and they keep their Existing stuff garbage.
**Jake Price:** And they don't fix it.
**Jake Price:** What does your dev roadmap?
**Jake Price:** Because you have this V2 coming out, which sounds great.
**Jake Price:** Is there a commitment to actually keeping quality before we roll out a bunch of other crap that we, we want to turn?

**Jon Kluger:** Like, I'm one of.
**Jon Kluger:** I technically am not a co founder.
**Jon Kluger:** I joined two weeks later.
**Jon Kluger:** All right.
**Jon Kluger:** We, the two co founders had their own agencies, marketing and email.
**Jon Kluger:** All the sorts of traditional use cases where you imagine they would be an Audience Lab user.
**Jon Kluger:** Right.
**Jon Kluger:** They despise the experience.
**Jon Kluger:** They despise the, the.
**Jon Kluger:** The data white label, everything from Audience Lab.
**Jon Kluger:** They wanted to create a solution because there's a clear gap in the market.
**Jon Kluger:** We have a tech.
**Jon Kluger:** Our tech lead has been doing this sort of Data with Fortune 100 companies for the last 15 years.
**Jon Kluger:** This database and this data set is not something that was built overnight.
**Jon Kluger:** This was his baby.
**Jon Kluger:** He finally got the contract to be able to then distribute this data to end users.
**Jon Kluger:** And now he wants to turn this into a half a billion dollar business.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're not, we're not just trying to get your money and sell you a single lifetime access license and then just completely disregard you and not care about you.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** Believe me, like, if, if you guys start to release all this other and the functionality is not there, like, I will voice it.

**Jon Kluger:** That's the stripe.
**Jon Kluger:** If you bet.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to pay, I can literally email Sydney, who's our onboarding specialist.
**Jon Kluger:** So literally have you an account within 24 hours.

**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** All right.
**Jake Price:** I've got the link open here.
**Jake Price:** Let us, Let us discuss.
**Jake Price:** Like, we weren't sure what we were going to end up doing, but at 1500, which is half, a little under half of what we were paying them per month.

**Jon Kluger:** Fifteen months, like at that point.
**Jon Kluger:** Like.
**Jon Kluger:** Yes.
**Jon Kluger:** And you.
**Jon Kluger:** If you don't like it, like, I, I'm trying to be a mensch here.
**Jon Kluger:** So I'm gonna reduce my amount that I crap on Audience Lab.
**Jon Kluger:** Sure.

**Jake Price:** You're a fellow member of the tribe.

**Taulant Dauti:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.

**Jake Price:** Feel free.

**Jon Kluger:** Feel free to continue.

**Jake Price:** Yes.

**Jon Kluger:** I, I've got the hidden name.
**Jon Kluger:** I, I recognize the price there.
**Jon Kluger:** So I'm not gonna lie.

**Jake Price:** You know, I've seen it go both ways.
**Jake Price:** You know, Christian, Jewish.
**Jake Price:** But anyway, I didn't really look at your last name now.
**Jake Price:** Okay.
**Jake Price:** I guess that'll.
**Jake Price:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** By the way, I forgot to ask.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm sorry, what was that?
**Jon Kluger:** Where are you guys based out of?

**Jake Price:** So we're just.
**Jake Price:** True.
**Jake Price:** So I'm in Southern California.
**Jake Price:** I was actually in Europe.

**Taulant Dauti:** Sometimes in Helsinki.
**Taulant Dauti:** Sometimes in Albania.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, nice.
**Jon Kluger:** I just, I just went out to that region for the first area.
**Jon Kluger:** Not in Albania, but I was in Bucharest.
**Jon Kluger:** My former company had our whole tech team out there.
**Jon Kluger:** So we, we went there.
**Jon Kluger:** When was this?
**Jon Kluger:** September.
**Jon Kluger:** It was interesting.
**Jon Kluger:** It like I, I had a good time, but my older co workers who were married were sitting there like, wow.
**Jon Kluger:** It really is just women dancing in the.
**Jon Kluger:** In bikinis at every bar, just standing there trying to get you to about go in and buy drinks.
**Jon Kluger:** And they're like, my wife.
**Jon Kluger:** Thank God my wife didn't come or I would have gotten in so much trouble.

**Taulant Dauti:** Well, thank God they didn't go to Spain, so that's, that's good.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, I went to Ibiza on the way back.
**Jon Kluger:** Nice.
**Jon Kluger:** I had my fun.
**Jon Kluger:** But.
**Jon Kluger:** No, that's great.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, just once you guys make your decision.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Just email me.
**Jon Kluger:** I appreciate it one way or the other.
**Jon Kluger:** If you say John, we're gonna wait.
**Jon Kluger:** If you say John, we never want to see you again, just let me know.
**Jon Kluger:** Otherwise I'm gonna send you email follow ups and then I'm going to be annoying.
**Jon Kluger:** And I don't want to be annoying.
**Jon Kluger:** I just have to be annoying sometimes.
**Jon Kluger:** So just, just give me a shout here.

**Jake Price:** We pay the link.
**Jake Price:** At that point I should email you saying, we paid.
**Jake Price:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** And I, I get an alert as well.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you fill it out and you use your name or you use.
**Jon Kluger:** Then I'll recognize it and I'll be able to just take care of it.

**Taulant Dauti:** Okay.

**Jake Price:** It'll be my name.

**Jon Kluger:** All right.
**Jon Kluger:** We're good for now.

**Jake Price:** Thank you.

**Jon Kluger:** Thank you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** Looking forward to working with each other.

**Jake Price:** Yeah, likewise.
**Jake Price:** Ta.
**Jake Price:** Let's hop on the other meeting.
**Jake Price:** See you.

**Jon Kluger:** Bye.
