## Transcript

**Nate Calhoun:** Michael, right?
**Nate Calhoun:** Yep.
**Nate Calhoun:** Awesome.
**Nate Calhoun:** Where are you going from?

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Where am I located?
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Yeah.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** New York and Florida.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** We have two locations.

**Nate Calhoun:** Oh, awesome.
**Nate Calhoun:** You're snow bunny.
**Nate Calhoun:** Snowbird.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** No, I don't go to New York ever again.

**Nate Calhoun:** That's what everybody says.
**Nate Calhoun:** I have a buddy, one of the other guys on the team is.
**Nate Calhoun:** He lives in Pennsylvania, and he's been wanting to move to Florida for so long.
**Nate Calhoun:** He's like.
**Nate Calhoun:** He says he just gets depressed in his house, who's always, like, cloudy and cold and.
**Nate Calhoun:** Yep.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** That's why I left, bro.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I was depressed.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I was literally depressed.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And I was like, I gotta get the hell out of here.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And ever since then, I'm much better overall.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I have.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I have colitis with, like, Crohn's disease.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I was in the hospital four times a year, miserable.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Can't leave my house.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I moved down to Florida.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** All my palms are gone.

**Nate Calhoun:** Really?

**The Stitch N Print Store:** You think it's been down here?
**The Stitch N Print Store:** It's the sun.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Yeah.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Been down here five years.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Haven't been in the hospital once.

**Nate Calhoun:** Yeah, it's crazy.
**Nate Calhoun:** My.
**Nate Calhoun:** My stomach actually.
**Nate Calhoun:** It's funny you said that.
**Nate Calhoun:** My stomach got messed up from taking a drug called Accutane, and that's actually the.
**Nate Calhoun:** The side effect of it, luckily.
**Nate Calhoun:** I. I mean, it just seems like dairy for the time being, but, yeah, it's kind of.
**Nate Calhoun:** It's kind of crazy, but.
**Nate Calhoun:** Yeah.
**Nate Calhoun:** What prompted you to.
**Nate Calhoun:** To book a call with us?
**Nate Calhoun:** I saw.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** I saw your ad that said using Audience Lab.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Right.

**Nate Calhoun:** Yep.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** So I'm using them for a couple months now, and I'm really not impressed at all.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** The data is just not accurate.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** The intent data is not accurate.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I haven't really got it got into the general list.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I'm sure that's more better.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I would hope.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I hope at least.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** But the intent, they.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** You know, they did it themselves because I said, hey, like, they did it during the demo, and then that was wrong.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And they just did another intent list, narrowing it down as much as they possibly can to people that are searching for my services.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And we reached out to these people, and they're like, we never went online.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** We never searched for anything that you're saying.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** We have no idea what you're talking about.

**Nate Calhoun:** You know, how were you guys reaching out to them?
**Nate Calhoun:** Were you running ads?
**Nate Calhoun:** Were you running email calls?
**Nate Calhoun:** We.
**Nate Calhoun:** We.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** I did a. I did a ringless voicemail.

**Nate Calhoun:** Yep.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Because text messages, people get pissed.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Emails go to spam.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So, you know, and we do all the things we can to improve our email deliverability.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** But.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So I was like, all right, bring Us voicemails.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** It's interesting.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Let's try it.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So we tried.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** It works if it was the right freaking people.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Because people call back.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** They'll, they'll.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Sometimes they don't even listen to send a message.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** You know, they just get a missed phone call.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** You know, I have a missed call from you.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** It's supposed to be a ringless voicemail, so I guess they're seeing it in their voicemail log.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So I don't know how they say.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I don't know why they say they have a missed call, but that's what they've been saying, oh, I have a missed call.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I'm like, oh, yeah, let me explain to them.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And they're like, nah, no idea.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Never been, never did it, never searched for it.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I'm like, great.

**Nate Calhoun:** So, yeah, we'll say to their defense, and they are a competitor, so.
**Nate Calhoun:** But in their defense, one of the big issues is that these platforms aren't really made for phone numbers.
**Nate Calhoun:** Because the issue here, you know, I don't.
**Nate Calhoun:** Audience labs, you know, data isn't.
**Nate Calhoun:** Isn't anything very special.
**Nate Calhoun:** In particular, you know, we, we have about two to five people a day signing up from audience Lab, funny enough, but just you know, generally in, in the space that we're in, how it works is the phone numbers usually come from a couple different providers.
**Nate Calhoun:** Now the issue with that is all the data can be perfectly accurate, but then the wrong phone number is getting matched to the wrong contact.
**Nate Calhoun:** So that's usually why, like, we have people that cold call and, you know, do stuff like that.
**Nate Calhoun:** But we usually recommend instead of just telling you.
**Nate Calhoun:** Yeah, I know we get a lot of people from audience lab that say, like, you know, the sales reps kind of told them, hey, you can just like, these are all Skip trace.
**Nate Calhoun:** They're 100 perfect phone numbers.
**Nate Calhoun:** It's not the case.
**Nate Calhoun:** You know, you can just use kind of common sense to deduce that, which is, you know, these platforms have over a billion phone numbers in them.
**Nate Calhoun:** So, like, the verification is.
**Nate Calhoun:** It's really a spectrum.
**Nate Calhoun:** There's no way to like, super highly accurately verify the phone numbers when there's over a billion phone numbers.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Do you think the emails are more accurate?

**Nate Calhoun:** Yeah, the emails are more accurate.
**Nate Calhoun:** Now you can use phone numbers.
**Nate Calhoun:** There's just, you know, how we recommend doing it is, you know, the standard process for using phone numbers is, you know, download the list that you want so, you know, you actually have the list that you want and then run that list through the do not call list.
**Nate Calhoun:** Any of these Platforms that say they're scrubbing for do not call list, it's not.
**Nate Calhoun:** There's no way to update billions of phone numbers a day.
**Nate Calhoun:** So same with emails, you want to run them through a verifier.
**Nate Calhoun:** Even if people say they're verified, Apollo zooming for, they'll say they're verified.
**Nate Calhoun:** They're not verified.
**Nate Calhoun:** They were verified, but you need to run them through a verifier.
**Nate Calhoun:** It's very cheap just to fix email deliverability.
**Nate Calhoun:** And then on the email deliverability, you want to use a platform like instantly or smartly.
**Nate Calhoun:** I don't know how you're doing it now, but there is a way to actually get near perfect deliverability with email.
**Nate Calhoun:** So I'd look into instantly or smart Lead.
**Nate Calhoun:** But then with the mobile numbers, once you pull that list that you want to voice mail drop or whatever you're wanting to do, call or sms, just run them through the do not call list and then run them through some sort of cheap verifier just to get an extra step in there.
**Nate Calhoun:** But yeah, even if you're doing phone numbers like you want to be dealing in quantities of a thousand plus a day, you know, it's not going to be something where you know, you can just pull a phone number from someone that said they're intentful and call them up and they're going to say, hey, I want to buy the product.
**Nate Calhoun:** But yeah, we just like to tell people that up front, you know, kind of set proper expectations.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Yeah, that's great.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** That's totally great.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Yeah, we're starting to work with smart lead instantly.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I've seen the email, I have the email email verification websites.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I have, I have a few we work with.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Which one do you like best?

**Nate Calhoun:** I mean, we just use million verifier and you can do it through API too.
**Nate Calhoun:** So it just feeds through.
**Nate Calhoun:** It's not really expensive.
**Nate Calhoun:** I think we just bought like a million credits, 350 bucks.
**Nate Calhoun:** But that'll last, you know, a year, right?

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Yeah, I think we use them once.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Yeah.

**Nate Calhoun:** But yeah, overall, are you guys, you know, more so looking for the audience builder, are you also using the website identification just so I'm kind of clear on what you're planning to use it for.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Say that question again.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I want to follow you.

**Nate Calhoun:** I'm sorry, are you guys using like the audience lab super pixels or is that not really, you know, important to you?

**The Stitch N Print Store:** We, I don't know.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I don't know the difference between a pixel and a super pixel.

**Nate Calhoun:** So forgive me, just the audience lab website identification.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** So we have the pics on our website.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Same exact thing.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Call the people back.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** They're like never been to any of you.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Talking about.

**Nate Calhoun:** Yeah, the website.
**Nate Calhoun:** The issue with all the website identification tools on the market is they're all basically built the same way.
**Nate Calhoun:** And they're usually in full transparency.
**Nate Calhoun:** They're usually about 60 to 75% accurate.
**Nate Calhoun:** Ours is going to be literally in line with that.
**Nate Calhoun:** It's going to be very similar to every other one on the market.
**Nate Calhoun:** That's not really our competitive advantage.
**Nate Calhoun:** Our competitive advantage is our audience builder.
**Nate Calhoun:** So the guy that actually built our platform, where, you know, Audience Lab, which is probably the biggest competitor they're fully focused on, basically make money online, people as well as agencies to resell their data.
**Nate Calhoun:** We come from a slightly different background where the guy that actually built our tool, he's been doing data and consulting for Fortune 500 companies for the last two decades.
**Nate Calhoun:** And over the last three to four years, he's basically built out the platform to commercialize the data so companies that aren't billion dollar companies can still use it, whether you're a small business, whether you're a marketing agency, or whether you're a cmo.
**Nate Calhoun:** But yeah, our big competitive advantage is our audience builder.
**Nate Calhoun:** And we're not allowed to say the name that we get the base data from, but it starts with a Z and it's the same exact place that, you know, the Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 companies are getting their data.
**Nate Calhoun:** There's not a single other source on the market that has better data than that provided.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Right, right.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I follow you.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Okay, and what's the cost?

**Nate Calhoun:** So the cost is quarterly.
**Nate Calhoun:** Quarterly at a 497amonth rate.
**Nate Calhoun:** So it's about 1500 bucks every three months.
**Nate Calhoun:** And that's unlimited.
**Nate Calhoun:** Everything you can pull hundreds, millions of records.
**Nate Calhoun:** The only caveat is that includes up to 10 pixels, slash super pixels.
**Nate Calhoun:** But then if you want additional ones, they're just 10 bucks each.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** So the pixels are the people that visit my website?

**Nate Calhoun:** Yeah.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** I'm sorry, what was that?

**Nate Calhoun:** I said I'll show you the platform here in a second too, so you can actually see it.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** I appreciate that.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So when you say 10, you're not talking about 10 visitors, you're talking about 10 actual pixels.

**Nate Calhoun:** Yeah, 10 actual pixels.
**Nate Calhoun:** And the website visitors are uncapped.
**Nate Calhoun:** So you could literally go put this on a e commerce site that's getting 10 million views a month and you're not paying any additional money.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Where, where, where would I put the pixel other than my website?
**The Stitch N Print Store:** That I would need more than one.

**Nate Calhoun:** Well, a lot of times.
**Nate Calhoun:** So are you, I guess.
**Nate Calhoun:** Are you.
**Nate Calhoun:** This is my fault.
**Nate Calhoun:** Are you just planning to use it yourself for your own company?
**Nate Calhoun:** Are you using this, you know, to service clients?

**The Stitch N Print Store:** I thought I follow you now.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Okay, so this I've been in, I have a business.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** We do, we do T shirt printing.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I've been doing it for 10 years.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** We do printing and embroidery.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And I started talking with audience last saw it, I was like, this is great because I'm at my wits end of this business.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I have a lot of equipment and employees and stores and stuff.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So trying to figure out how to kind of slow things down and start getting.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Selling stuff off and closing stores.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I'm tired of it, man.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I've been doing the same shit for 10 years and I'm like losing my mind.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I don't, I don't have the patience anymore for these customers, man.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** It's nuts.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So I'm like, let me start a digital marketing company because if I want to go to Italy for a month and I could fucking bounce and open my laptop and you know what I'm saying?
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I don't want to be in the production space anymore is what I'm getting at.

**Nate Calhoun:** It's.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** It's so complicated.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** All the machines and all the employees and training and turnover and blah, blah, blah.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And then there's no loyal customers out there and you're.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** You're competing with the kid who just started in his basement that's giving it away for a dollar.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And I mean, and you know, they don't know business and how to do numbers.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So they're like, oh, I do.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I'll do your shirt for a dollar.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And I'm like, dude, I'm making tennis shirt.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** You're making a dollar shirt.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Like, it's crazy.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Anyway, so it's getting very oversaturated and very difficult to make money nowadays.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So I'm like looking for something else to do and I have to get that up and started and going.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** But I need, I need the right partner where I know the data is good and everything is on the up and up, you know?

**Nate Calhoun:** Yeah, for sure.
**Nate Calhoun:** And if you're looking to white label the platform, the great part about it is you, you sort of get the freedom to do it or structure it however you want.
**Nate Calhoun:** So we have white label partners that are, you know, reselling pixels to roofing companies or other small businesses.
**Nate Calhoun:** And then on the whole other side of things, because our data is actually unlimited, we have people that'll sell one sub account to a larger insurance company for, you know, 10 to $20,000 a month on an annual contract.
**Nate Calhoun:** So you sort of can go after any market you want.
**Nate Calhoun:** You can price it however you want.
**Nate Calhoun:** If you want to price charge people per record, or you want to create your own different pricing tiers where there's, you know, different quantities of pixels they can have, or the number of people they can identify, or the number of lists they're allowed to pull.
**Nate Calhoun:** You basically have full freedom to structure that however you want.
**Nate Calhoun:** Right now, the white label is a different price than the core plan.
**Nate Calhoun:** But what you can always do is if you want to use it yourself to try it out.
**Nate Calhoun:** Like what a lot of our customers do is they sign up for the platform before they actually start white labeling it, just to do their due diligence on the quality of the data and how it works and kind of get familiar with the platform and then they move over to the white label.
**Nate Calhoun:** And what we allow you to do as well is we're having a big update that's coming out.
**Nate Calhoun:** So the version two of our platform is coming out February 15th.
**Nate Calhoun:** That's when it's planned for.
**Nate Calhoun:** The entire interface is going to be a lot better than it is now.
**Nate Calhoun:** There's going to be more functionality.
**Nate Calhoun:** Basically anything is going to be be able to be done in it as well as it's going to make it really easy for someone like you that's wanting to start reselling it to be able to focus on selling it and not dealing with support.
**Nate Calhoun:** Because the issue that you're going to run into is once you get the first 10, 20 clients, which most likely won't be that hard because, you know, data's not really commoditized yet.
**Nate Calhoun:** So it's very easy to position yourself and get calls.
**Nate Calhoun:** Like, for example, you booked a call with us, we paid like $9 to get you on a call.
**Nate Calhoun:** So it's very.
**Nate Calhoun:** There's a lot of product market fit, there's a lot of demand for this.
**Nate Calhoun:** And the best part is you can sell it to any company, whether it's a roofing company, whether it's a Fortune 500 company or anything in between.
**Nate Calhoun:** But what's going to be good for people that are white labeling the platform once that update comes out is all of the videos and the support is going to already be made for you, all under your own brand automatically.
**Nate Calhoun:** So inside the platform, there's going to be videos basically walking people through everything.
**Nate Calhoun:** So it's going to lessen your support load.
**Nate Calhoun:** And then as well as how it works is you'll have like an agency admin panel where you can set everyone's limits.
**Nate Calhoun:** It's very, very straightforward.
**Nate Calhoun:** And you also have a dedicated Slack channel with members from our team, as well as an engineer in there.
**Nate Calhoun:** So if you have any clients that run into issues or anything like that, you're basically just able to send it in Slack to the engineer and they'll respond, they'll log into their account and.
**Nate Calhoun:** And fix whatever's happening or figure out what's ever happening.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Gotcha.

**Nate Calhoun:** But yeah, where I was going with that is what will.
**Nate Calhoun:** What we actually do, which is really cool, is you can sign up for the core plan, and then once that version two comes out and you want to, you know, you're familiar with the data, you pass it.
**Nate Calhoun:** It's great.
**Nate Calhoun:** You can actually credit the amount that you paid for the personal plan to the white label plan.
**Nate Calhoun:** So you're not having to like sign up for one plan and then pay 100%, you know, all the money again, for the white label.
**Nate Calhoun:** We'll actually credit it towards the white label.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Right, okay.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And the 497 is the white label.

**Nate Calhoun:** So the 497 is the standard plan.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** The core.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Yeah.

**Nate Calhoun:** Okay.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Okay.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So how much?
**The Stitch N Print Store:** The white label.

**Nate Calhoun:** So the white label is 3,000amonth, and that includes 10 seats.
**Nate Calhoun:** And then each additional seat is 100 bucks.
**Nate Calhoun:** So what you're looking to do off the bat is get $3,000 a month in revenue coming in from selling it to people.
**Nate Calhoun:** And then after that, you're making, you know, 95% margin on everything that you sell.
**Nate Calhoun:** And that's where it, you know, becomes very advantageous for you.
**Nate Calhoun:** So you basically get all the.
**Nate Calhoun:** You get all the meat on the bone.
**Nate Calhoun:** You know, your, your cost is basically zero.
**Nate Calhoun:** You know, once you get past the $3,000 in revenue, which could be one customer.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Yeah, right, right, right, right.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Okay.

**Nate Calhoun:** And then I'll show you the platform real quick just so you can kind of see it.
**Nate Calhoun:** If I rant too much or you get confused, just stop me.
**Nate Calhoun:** I'm not really a sales guy, more of a tech guy.
**Nate Calhoun:** So sometimes they'll just tell you too much that you don't want to hear.
**Nate Calhoun:** So just feel free to cut me off.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** But no problem.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I got, I got a meeting at 3:30.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I'm sure you do too.

**Nate Calhoun:** Awesome.
**Nate Calhoun:** Yep.
**Nate Calhoun:** So I just run through a really quick.
**Nate Calhoun:** Stop me if you have a, you know, any questions?
**Nate Calhoun:** But.
**Nate Calhoun:** So these, this is a Inc. 5000 business funding company out of New York.
**Nate Calhoun:** They do like SBA loans Stuff like that.
**Nate Calhoun:** And just using their account.
**Nate Calhoun:** So you can see like a live account that someone actually is using.
**Nate Calhoun:** They gave us permission to use this.
**Nate Calhoun:** So you can see in the last, you know, whatever time period you want to set it at, you know, this month, let's just see this month.
**Nate Calhoun:** This month they've had 23,000 people hit their website.
**Nate Calhoun:** And we were able to identify over 11,000 of those people that visited the site, even though they didn't fill anything out.
**Nate Calhoun:** So we're picking up 48% of the people that come to the site.
**Nate Calhoun:** You can see the top pages that were visited, where the traffic actually came from, as well as where the people that are coming onto the site are in terms of city.
**Nate Calhoun:** And then this map, you're able to see every single person that visited the site down to their literal home address.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Right.

**Nate Calhoun:** Which is kind of scary.
**Nate Calhoun:** And then website identification is basically just where you're going to see all the people, you know, that it's saying it identified.
**Nate Calhoun:** So you're going to see basically every person, you're going to get their full name and their personal email, and then you'll get about 40 to 50% of people, their business email, their LinkedIn companies they're associated with.
**Nate Calhoun:** And then if you scroll over, you'll see every single person's address, phone number, city, state, zip code, what source they came from.
**Nate Calhoun:** So if they came from Google, if they came from an ad, if they came from a blog on another page.
**Nate Calhoun:** So this company does a lot of SEO, so that's why you'll see someone like these.
**Nate Calhoun:** You can also see the exact user path as well.
**Nate Calhoun:** So you can see this person was looking at Laundromat startup cost page on their site.
**Nate Calhoun:** These people, the index ppc, those are just people that were coming from the, the Google Ads that they're running.
**Nate Calhoun:** So that's why you see so many of those.
**Nate Calhoun:** And you can see this person was looking at business loan stuff.
**Nate Calhoun:** And you can actually see the last page that they visited was thank you page, meaning they actually booked a call.
**Nate Calhoun:** And you can actually see the email that they submitted the form with, which is pretty cool, right?
**Nate Calhoun:** And then, yeah, if you scroll over a little bit more, it gets even more fascinating.
**Nate Calhoun:** You can click see more on any of these people, see their full name, their email, their phone device type, gender, age, birthday, marital status, religion.
**Nate Calhoun:** And this is all without them filling out a single thing on the page.
**Nate Calhoun:** You can see where they live, you can see their financial information.
**Nate Calhoun:** You can see if they're a homeowner, if they're a renter, what companies they're associated with, as well as their personal email addresses.
**Nate Calhoun:** And then out of their personal email addresses, we have a way to basically detect which one they're using the most.
**Nate Calhoun:** And that's what gets put as their primary personal email.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Right, okay.

**Nate Calhoun:** And what's really cool as well is you can actually see, even though this person just visited the page today, we match them to our identity graph.
**Nate Calhoun:** So we're able to actually see what this person has been looking at every day for the last month.
**Nate Calhoun:** So last week, last six days, last five days, every buying intent that they've shown across the Internet.
**Nate Calhoun:** And we're tracking over 80% of the US adult population, and we're tracking over 10 billion searches and signals a day would be.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** So that's the visit.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** That's people that actually visit the website, right?
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Yeah.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So how do you build an audience that has intent data?
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Looking for someone looking to print T shirts, custom T shirts.

**Nate Calhoun:** So you would use the audience builder.
**Nate Calhoun:** So we have three functionalities.
**Nate Calhoun:** You can pull static lists.
**Nate Calhoun:** So this is just.
**Nate Calhoun:** You don't want intent.
**Nate Calhoun:** You want to pull A list of CTOs of pharmaceutical companies between a hundred million and a quarter million or 100 million, 200 million a year in revenue.
**Nate Calhoun:** You can pull that and then intend B2B and 10 B2C.
**Nate Calhoun:** You can pull those lists as well.
**Nate Calhoun:** So like, print, I would do probably.
**Nate Calhoun:** Let's see print.
**Nate Calhoun:** See print on demand.
**Nate Calhoun:** So I do some like print on demand.
**Nate Calhoun:** If you're looking for like people that are trying to use you for fulfillment, if you're selling retail, what are people searching for exactly?

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Custom T shirts.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Is that.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I mean, on Google, custom T shirts is the biggest keyword.

**Nate Calhoun:** So some of these are hard to find.
**Nate Calhoun:** So we have a list of about 50,000 topics.
**Nate Calhoun:** Some of them are like spelled weirdly.
**Nate Calhoun:** So usually what we recommend is you take the list of 50,000 topics and you just put it into chat GPT and tell it what type of person you're looking for.
**Nate Calhoun:** And it'll tell you which topics you know, most closely align with that.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** But.

**Nate Calhoun:** But that's probably in the ballpark of what I would do.
**Nate Calhoun:** Shirts.
**Nate Calhoun:** You have any other intent that you would want to pull?

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Just T shirt printing or embroidery or not a T shirt.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** I'm sorry, T shirt printing, but I don't think you have any of that.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** How about embroidery?

**Nate Calhoun:** How do you spell that?

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Yeah, D E, R, Y.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** You have it right so far.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** D E, R, Y. Yeah.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** So yeah, it's the same thing.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Like they're having over there at Audience Lab, it was just print on demand.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** And then what they did was they were able to build a custom audience and take out the print on demand and just focus on the T shirt printing part of printing on demand.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** Does that make sense?

**Nate Calhoun:** Yeah.
**Nate Calhoun:** No.
**Nate Calhoun:** So that's one of the good things.
**Nate Calhoun:** At least in the v2 update, you'll be able to search any sort of keyword as well.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Okay.

**Nate Calhoun:** Even though we don't have it right now, the biggest issue too with the keyword search is we actually already have it functioning.
**Nate Calhoun:** We just haven't released it because we don't want it to be like audience labs where we get a lot of complaints that their keyword searches don't really.
**Nate Calhoun:** They're not really accurate at all.
**Nate Calhoun:** And basically what's happening behind the scenes is there's bunches of providers that do specific keywords, but the issue is you have to go through and one by one vet them because 80% of them suck.
**Nate Calhoun:** So that's basically the process that we're in right now, is we're going through and basically sourcing the vendors for all the keywords.
**Nate Calhoun:** But we want to make sure before we release it that, you know, it's actually getting what you want.
**Nate Calhoun:** You know, instead of just pushing it out early and people getting upset, we'd rather make sure it's done the right way.

**The Stitch N Print Store:** Sounds good.
**The Stitch N Print Store:** All right, great.
