## Transcript

**Jodi Blank:** Am working with, I work with companies who are at around the 1 to 3 million mark and try to get them to, you know, that 5 to 10 million mark.
**Jodi Blank:** I have one current client possibly and so I have a way that I can get my own clients.
**Jodi Blank:** What I'm looking for with this is do something completely separate.
**Jodi Blank:** And I've, I've talked to Audience Lab before and that's why you guys caught my attention with your ad.
**Jodi Blank:** So what I liked about Audience Lab is that I know how to run Facebook ads and being able to just have an agency that runs data to, you know, hire higher level clients that are running their own ads like within their company and adding this in is what I'm kind of looking at.
**Jodi Blank:** So that's my story.

**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** And you said, are you currently working with Audience Lab or have you worked with them in the past?

**Jodi Blank:** I have not.
**Jodi Blank:** I've been on two calls with them.
**Jodi Blank:** I've gone through like every ounce of every sales page and watched every testimonial.
**Jodi Blank:** And so I'm pretty familiar with what they're doing.
**Jodi Blank:** What I like about them.
**Jodi Blank:** And I guess my biggest question about what the difference is is obviously cost, but besides cost is they have a lot of like group calls to help through things and have a lot of like teaching on how to, how to do everything.
**Jodi Blank:** I've worked with, I did work with another company that had some intent data and I actually, for my current client, they have access to, I have access to sales zoom info.
**Jodi Blank:** So I'm familiar with some of the other things out there.
**Jodi Blank:** So.

**Jon Kluger:** If you don't have to disclose this, I always like to ask so I can cater this to you personally.
**Jon Kluger:** Which offering was Audience Lab?
**Jon Kluger:** I don't want to say pushing, but which offering were they talking with you about?
**Jon Kluger:** Was it the white label or the traditional?
**Jon Kluger:** Just for my understanding.

**Jodi Blank:** We never really talked about, I know they offer white label, but we never really talked about white label.
**Jodi Blank:** That's something that I thought about.
**Jodi Blank:** But really when I talked to them, the second call that I had with them was more informative, I think.
**Jodi Blank:** And I was thinking about like, you know, how, which avenue do I take?
**Jodi Blank:** And the one that just really interested me is because I know Facebook ads, I can talk Facebook ads.
**Jodi Blank:** I know probably a lot more than most ads managers do, especially if they're at a company.
**Jodi Blank:** So I would be comfortable selling, you know, data to them because I can talk about it.
**Jodi Blank:** They weren't really.
**Jodi Blank:** What they were saying is you start at their beginner level, which is like, I think it's Like a thousand dollars and you get two pixels or something like that.
**Jodi Blank:** I don't remember exactly what it was, but.
**Jodi Blank:** And then I could move up from there, but, but he was saying when I talked to him that the other guy that they have, that they talk about all the time, who's doing this with Facebook ads is spending about $4,000 a month on data or on, however, whatever it is that they're doing.
**Jodi Blank:** And then he's making 50 per month.

**Jon Kluger:** So, so we are, I think, moving like transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** We recognize Audience Lab, they've been around for, for a few years now and they've done an okay job.
**Jon Kluger:** What they don't do a great job of is I have a background in data analytics, I went to school for it.
**Jon Kluger:** I've been working with data driven companies, AI companies, you know, billion dollar organizations for the last almost 10 years.
**Jon Kluger:** And the one thing that every single person in the data world believes in is testing and variance, being able to look at audiences not just in a singular instance, but to be able to look at many different views.
**Jon Kluger:** The thing that we do, very different to Audience Lab.
**Jon Kluger:** So we don't cap you on audiences, we don't cap you on this size, we don't cap you on essentially anything.
**Jon Kluger:** All we cap is direct integration currently from go high level HubSpot, what have you.
**Jon Kluger:** You can connect unlimited meta connectors right now.
**Jon Kluger:** There's nothing stopping you there.
**Jon Kluger:** We do have a Google Ads connector and we start you with a standard 5 pixels.
**Jon Kluger:** All of that with our current quarterly promotion, which is for V1, so.
**Jon Kluger:** So by the way, V2 releases February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to be more robust, it's going to be easier UI UX, we're going to add another 10 plus integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** It's everything and anything you can imagine.
**Jon Kluger:** And we're only about $500 a month.
**Jon Kluger:** So not only do we provide you with no confinement, no handcuffs to two audiences where if you change one filter you have to pay to upgrade to a new audience.
**Jon Kluger:** We let you experiment, we let you explore, we let you be curious because some of the best discoveries are when you're curious and you test so much.
**Jon Kluger:** So we've actually seen clients that are seeing a reduction in their cost by 50% and a doubling in their conversions.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's because they're looking at, hey, this was the initial audience that we were looking at.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe if we filter it like this and you look at something a little bit more niche, will perform even better.
**Jon Kluger:** And that slight ability to make modifications to explore has been a game Changer.
**Jon Kluger:** For a lot of our clients, we have anywhere between two to three customers a day.
**Jon Kluger:** Switch over from Audience Lab because they said, hey, I started with them, I only needed two audiences, now I have five and I'm paying two grand a month.
**Jon Kluger:** With us you can have as many audiences you want, you can as many pixels as you want.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to create instances that are white label with your brand and then actually let your clients then use it, we can set that up for you as well.
**Jon Kluger:** What I recommend to start from the sounds of our conversation is just starting with a single license with the quarterly where you get it for 500 bucks a month.
**Jon Kluger:** The beautiful part is, is if you lock in at that $500 for V1, when we launch V2 in two weeks, you'll be grandfathered in and that price won't change.
**Jon Kluger:** So we don't believe in the get you in the door, you start using it and then all of a sudden you have these handcuffs on you that you need the magic key that costs an extra $500 a month to break out.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't do that.
**Jon Kluger:** We just want you to be able to be that point of contact and that that service for your clients.
**Jon Kluger:** Because we know every time if prices suddenly increase, you're either paying out of pocket for that, where you have to pass that expense on to your client.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's never a conversation that people enjoy to have is turning to a client and say, hey, actually I need more money from you.
**Jon Kluger:** I know and enjoys that.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, I'll walk you through a bit of the platform.
**Jon Kluger:** Feel free to jump in with any questions if you have any questions.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll hear me mention a couple of things that V1 currently doesn't have, but V2 will transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** What we did with, with the V2 rollout is we didn't want to do like an agile rollout.
**Jon Kluger:** We wanted to do a full launch.
**Jon Kluger:** So there is a plethora of new features, improvements coming in.
**Jon Kluger:** So when V2 comes out, it will be the exact same functionality in terms of data in the back end, but it's going to almost look like a flushed out, brand new sort of environment because it's just going to be that much better.
**Jon Kluger:** Alex is actually here as well.
**Jon Kluger:** He's one of the co founders.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I was talking to you earlier over text when you're pushing that meeting.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I got caught up with a client.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm gonna pop in and say hi, but John's gonna take care of you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** He's doing a great job.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I just wanted to say hi and, and make sure you were all set.

**Jodi Blank:** Okay, I appreciate that.
**Jodi Blank:** Thank you.

**Jon Kluger:** Awesome guys.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll take the pressure off.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Jody, I'm gonna jump.

**Jon Kluger:** John, I'll circle up with you later today.
**Jon Kluger:** Alex.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Sounds good.

**Jon Kluger:** Appreciate you guys.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me actually, I just need to ping him real quick before I forget, So let me go ahead and walk you through.
**Jon Kluger:** I know I talk a lot.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm be the first to admit.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have a question, don't wait for a pause.
**Jon Kluger:** There might never be one.
**Jon Kluger:** Feel free to interrupt me, okay?
**Jon Kluger:** It's the easiest thing to do and I trust me.
**Jon Kluger:** Matt's known me for, for years.
**Jon Kluger:** I will not be offended.
**Jon Kluger:** If anything, I welcome it.
**Jon Kluger:** So first thing you're going to see here, this is what a single pixel will provide within our homepage.
**Jon Kluger:** What you're going to see first and foremost is we have about on average of 40 to 70% identification rate.
**Jon Kluger:** I know that's a big range.
**Jon Kluger:** It really just varies depending on how the website set up, what sort of cookies are required, et cetera.
**Jon Kluger:** If there is nothing, we typically see about a 40% rate.
**Jon Kluger:** So I like to always be very transparent about that.
**Jon Kluger:** One of the things that's super duper nice is on this homepage you can see your top performing pages, your top performing sources, where they might be coming in.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you're running ads, instead of organic being number one, it's Facebook or it's Instagram, you can easily highlight that to your client.
**Jon Kluger:** And the beautiful part is since this is regarding the pixels, you can have a single license with five of your clients as pixels here and they'll never be able to and you don't need to create additional instances what have you.
**Jon Kluger:** So for your current functional needs, this would be perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** You would just add a pixel right here, put it on in.
**Jon Kluger:** Once you add it on in here on the homepage, you'd have a dropdown where you can just switch over.
**Jon Kluger:** Additionally, what I really enjoy is the heat map element.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say I like to use this Texas Fort Worth area as a good example.
**Jon Kluger:** When you're looking from a distance, it looks like one, one sort of location.
**Jon Kluger:** But if you start to zoom in, what you'll see is Dallas Fort Worth and even Arlington have different heat points.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I think this is super valuable is if you have any sort of customer with a physical location, or if you have any sort of customer that's focusing on specific geography, you're able to actually see how that directly correlates with website visitors.
**Jon Kluger:** So I think it's super nice.
**Jon Kluger:** It sometimes applies to some more than others.
**Jon Kluger:** I mean we can get pretty granular to the exact address.
**Jon Kluger:** I work with some companies that partner with service based, service based businesses.
**Jon Kluger:** So like roofers actually take this website information on this page and they'll actually take the addresses from everybody and create a knocking path where they'll literally go door to door of the website visitors and basically say to them, hey, you know, are you in the market for roofing?
**Jon Kluger:** I was driving by your house today and I just so happen to see you're.
**Jon Kluger:** No, you're missing a shingle or two.
**Jon Kluger:** If you've been thinking about potential roofing partners and then they might look at the name on the, on the shirt and go oh, I actually was just on your, your website earlier this week.
**Jon Kluger:** It's so funny that you're coming by.
**Jon Kluger:** I love to talk more.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we're able to look pretty extensively in terms of data.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see here on the top, it's the basic kind of general personal information.
**Jon Kluger:** Are they married, are they single, do they have kids, do they not?
**Jon Kluger:** You can see where they're located, their income and net worth range, phone numbers, device id, IP and then even all the different behaviors that they've been showing across the web.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, normally down here you'll also be able to see if they are a homeowner, it will list the property.
**Jon Kluger:** If they own a vehicle, we'll list the vehicle make and year as well.
**Jon Kluger:** I always like to mention a vehicle because it can be actually pretty valuable if you, let's say you're an auto dealer or transparent.
**Jon Kluger:** Alternatively if you're like a European car repair services place, you're not going to target people with Toyotas, you want to target people with Mercedes, BMW, Audi and those very expensive niche brands.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to export this, super easy, just hit export.
**Jon Kluger:** We have no cap on this as well.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you are killing it and you have hundreds and thousands of visitors a day, hell yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Great job.
**Jon Kluger:** Way to go Jody.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not going to tell you.
**Jon Kluger:** You only get access to the first 2,500.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say purely focused on providing you all of the data for your data needs in a one stop shop that is a nickel and diamond yell if we go ahead.
**Jon Kluger:** Over here there's also the option for direct name.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you wanted to create a trigger that when someone goes onto a website and they fill out a form, you want them to receive a piece of mail and easily set that up.
**Jon Kluger:** You can have the design yourself set up the design and just have this trigger flow that typically costs about 90 cents to start, including postage.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't have to use us if you have an alternative provider.
**Jon Kluger:** I will not be heartbroken.
**Jon Kluger:** I understand.
**Jon Kluger:** But I always like to mention this as a nice little add in feature within the platform that allows for you to do so if you wish.
**Jon Kluger:** Now the analytics on the website is also pretty cool too.
**Jon Kluger:** This is going to be a lot bigger.
**Jon Kluger:** There's going to be a lot more to look at in V2.
**Jon Kluger:** But as you can see, you can right off the bat see the income, audience, age, the gender, what device they're accessing it on and even where their traffic is coming from.
**Jon Kluger:** So the analytics page is a nice little secondary ability to to look a little bit deeper in terms of integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** I know I mentioned that before, these are.
**Jon Kluger:** Or V1 V2 will have Google sheets.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll have a bunch of other things added to help with either enrichment or even passing information back over.
**Jon Kluger:** We typically only connect a single HubSpot go high level or CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is we want to make sure there is no possibility of an error in terms of transferring data over, pushing data, setting schedules.

**Jodi Blank:** Yeah, that makes sense.

**Jon Kluger:** If you need additional integrations while having a single license mbt, we will have that available.
**Jon Kluger:** It will cost an additional amount.
**Jon Kluger:** I think it's just going to be like $50 a month per additional HubSpot per additional go high level.
**Jon Kluger:** But Meta connector has unlimited so you don't have to worry with Meta if you are just running the ads, not pushing to the CRM or if they are getting pushed to the CRM and you're just sending a CSV that gets uploaded.
**Jon Kluger:** You can live in Lenta, do whatever you want.
**Jon Kluger:** Additionally, we do have a couple additional on this as well, which is pretty nice.
**Jon Kluger:** Now going into the fun part, the audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing I always like to highlight before we dive in.
**Jon Kluger:** This was yesterday, no, two days ago.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me.
**Jon Kluger:** This is a live account by the way.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not, we're not playing in some playground.
**Jon Kluger:** As you can see, these are all different audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** And in just what is that five hour span it's probably 3.5 million records that were pulled.
**Jon Kluger:** So when I say no, no caps on anything.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not kidding.
**Jon Kluger:** Like this is Jodi search to your heart's extent.
**Jon Kluger:** See what the lists make sense.
**Jon Kluger:** Add filters, remove filters, do whatever you need to do to create that perfect set of data for your for your partners.
**Jon Kluger:** Then all you have to do is save it as a query.
**Jon Kluger:** Once it's saved as a query, you can easily schedule it to repeat every day, every other day, every week.
**Jon Kluger:** You can schedule it to the ad account as well.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say if you want to refresh every day the people that have shown intent and push out, the people that have expanded have exceeded a certain amount of time.
**Jon Kluger:** You can easily have that set up for each and every one of your clients and then just sit back and relax.

**Jodi Blank:** Okay.
**Jodi Blank:** How easy is it to set set up within somebody's ad account?
**Jodi Blank:** I mean, is it two?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** And with V2 it's going to be even easier.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now it's set up using webhook but in V2 it's going to be a lot more direct where it's a lot easier for you to just click click bank.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, now when we go to build an audience, you have a couple options here.
**Jon Kluger:** The AI assistant is not the best right now.
**Jon Kluger:** We much better in V2 we just kind of put it there as a little bit of a way to give a little bit of guidance.
**Jon Kluger:** What you see on advanced search here is imagine this is the Zoom Info filter tab with no intent, nothing to do with it.
**Jon Kluger:** You add a rule, you select your field, you add another rule, you select your field, you hit build.
**Jon Kluger:** This is where you're going to see some astronomically large lists.
**Jon Kluger:** We typically don't recommend building lists here because no intent included isn't necessarily the best.
**Jon Kluger:** Unless you're trying to say find every C level executive in chartered pharmaceuticals in the United States with a business that makes more than X, Y and Z.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have a nice search, go for it.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're looking for a big list, use intent because that's going to allow for you to make sure you're actually hitting the most the people that are actually getting buying signals as soon as possible.
**Jon Kluger:** So you'll see a couple options here.
**Jon Kluger:** We have B2C and we have B2B.
**Jon Kluger:** B2C is.
**Jon Kluger:** It's similar to Audience Lab in The sense of B2C is consumer level product selling directly to someone that's going to purchase something for themselves.
**Jon Kluger:** B2B is looking at someone showing buying signals for a business related thing.
**Jon Kluger:** So I always like this.
**Jon Kluger:** For example, like for HubSpot would be a B2B if someone is looking for HubSpot or HubSpot related services that is doing with their business.
**Jon Kluger:** But let's say we go over here, we do Car Rental.
**Jon Kluger:** 9 out of 10 times a car rental or a roof.
**Jon Kluger:** Roofing is more so for someone on a consumer level.

**Jodi Blank:** Sure.

**Jon Kluger:** So we can go ahead and build an example.
**Jon Kluger:** Did you want to look B2B or B2C to start?

**Jodi Blank:** Let's.
**Jodi Blank:** Let's try B2C.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Is there a specific use case that you would like to look at?

**Jodi Blank:** Yeah, test out maybe chiropractors.

**Jon Kluger:** I have an appointment later.
**Jon Kluger:** Chiropractic care.
**Jon Kluger:** What we're going to do is also set the intent window to two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** We only look at two weeks in intent data.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is typically if someone's showing buying signs and a two week frame, they've already made actionable moves.
**Jon Kluger:** Be anytime beyond that.
**Jon Kluger:** Someone's looking for a chiropractor, they're probably booking an appointment within 24 to 48 hours if we're being realistic.
**Jon Kluger:** With that being said.
**Jon Kluger:** Would you like to provide a specific state?

**Jodi Blank:** Yeah, sure do.
**Jodi Blank:** Wisconsin.

**Jon Kluger:** Wisconsin.
**Jon Kluger:** Nice.
**Jon Kluger:** I went to Milwaukee for the first time last year.

**Jodi Blank:** Oh yeah?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** I liked was not the winter, so that definitely helped.
**Jon Kluger:** It was the middle of August so it was like perfect, like 75 degrees.
**Jon Kluger:** We went down to the water walk.
**Jon Kluger:** There was this steakhouse I went to that was phenomenal.
**Jon Kluger:** And I don't remember what its name was, but it was like 100-year-old steakhouse.
**Jon Kluger:** Really enjoyable time.
**Jon Kluger:** Now we did Wisconsin Chiropractic care.
**Jon Kluger:** Do we want to look at a specific age?
**Jon Kluger:** Do we want to look at any other kind of attributes that might contribute?

**Jodi Blank:** Yeah.
**Jodi Blank:** Try pregnancy.

**Jon Kluger:** So we can't do pregnancy, but we can do kids.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, you want to do married?
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, married.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll say in.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll say yes.
**Jon Kluger:** So then we'll hit build audience.
**Jon Kluger:** What this is going to do is now we're currently doing the poll from our original database for your reference.
**Jon Kluger:** Our database is the same database that is leveraged by Fortune 100 companies.
**Jon Kluger:** We actually are unique.
**Jon Kluger:** We are one of less than five people in the world in terms of companies that have access to our data set.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is our technical founder has been working with these Fortune 100 companies and data provider for over 15 years.
**Jon Kluger:** What it looked like before this was him just programming SQL that was not very conducive of a platform for people to use.
**Jon Kluger:** He worked with his data partner and they agreed to allow for him to be able to build this platform and allow for people like yourselves to access a database that normally would cost at least $250,000 a month to access.
**Jon Kluger:** So where we differ from Audience Lab as well.
**Jon Kluger:** Audience Lab, Zoominfo, Apollo, all of those tap into a database called five by five.
**Jon Kluger:** Five by five is here.
**Jon Kluger:** We go above, we go to the data source that's even more expensive, even more robust.
**Jon Kluger:** And then what we do is we actually waterfall enrich our Data with additional 200 data sources to fill in any gaps and add additional intent information.
**Jon Kluger:** So I know it says 15 to 20 minutes, that's not the case, don't worry.
**Jon Kluger:** We just say that because we've had a couple clients who are a little bit impatient and we just wanted them to be able to be like, wait a second.
**Jon Kluger:** What I always say is check your phone, see if you got any texts, go to your computer, check your emails, come back and simply hit refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** Now what you're going to see here as you're going to see people who are married men or women.
**Jon Kluger:** So maybe, maybe dad's been hurting his back doing work around the house that are showing intent based on chiropractic care.
**Jon Kluger:** As you can see here, the left side is personal information.
**Jon Kluger:** As we scroll to the right we will have the business information as it relates to these.
**Jon Kluger:** Since this is a B2C reach, there isn't as robust of a B2B result.
**Jon Kluger:** But what you will still be able to see nonetheless is net worth income range, even their age, married, children, homeowner or not, which can be pretty, pretty, pretty valuable in instances like this.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say you get this list back, Jody, and you go 20,000.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a lot.
**Jon Kluger:** That's way too much.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe I want to narrow this down.
**Jon Kluger:** You just go back and build a new audience using the same filters, maybe add another and you're good to go.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't have to worry about hitting a support ticket and saying, I messed up on my audience.
**Jon Kluger:** Can you edit it for me?
**Jon Kluger:** Can I do this?
**Jon Kluger:** Can I do that?
**Jon Kluger:** Now you're good to go.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, what does this look like on an export?
**Jon Kluger:** No problem.
**Jon Kluger:** This is what a standard export looks like.
**Jon Kluger:** On the left here you'll see our favorite identification tool, the SHA256.
**Jon Kluger:** So Meta can identify and match the user to their profile.
**Jon Kluger:** Internally, this is the most important identifier when it comes to meta ads.
**Jon Kluger:** We have statistically found not only that, as you can see, we have an incredibly high match rate for that which it directly relates to why we're able to see so much success.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, on the export, you'll see essentially every single tab from the other one.
**Jon Kluger:** In V2 you'll be able to, when you do an export and download, filter out and determine which tabs you actually Want.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you just want to provide your partners with the basic contact information and not the in depth income range network, all of that, you can easily manage that.
**Jon Kluger:** So it can just become a download.
**Jon Kluger:** Passover, done.

**Jodi Blank:** Okay.
**Jodi Blank:** Now in what case would I just be, I guess I'm always thinking ads.
**Jodi Blank:** In what case would I just be downloading a list and sending it to a client so that they can, they can upload it into meta themselves for a lookalike audience or to send ads just to them?
**Jodi Blank:** Is that how I would be doing it?

**Jon Kluger:** So the only time that people really do the downloads and then sending it over is if they're selling lists.
**Jon Kluger:** I always mention it because I have people that I work with that they have four customers that they run the ads for.
**Jon Kluger:** They have four customers that they literally just send lists too.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's how they make money.
**Jon Kluger:** They, they get paid 1000 bucks a month to give someone hot leads essentially.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, that's when you would do the download.
**Jon Kluger:** Otherwise what you can do is you would select download all, say chiropractor, chiropractor, Wisconsin married.
**Jon Kluger:** You would select these, hit save and then this would be queued up to download.
**Jon Kluger:** In the meantime, what you can do, as I mentioned before, so you can schedule it to refresh however often you want, send it directly to the ad account as is, or you can schedule to send it.
**Jon Kluger:** We either choose the meta or the Google and you can determine how often you want it to refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only the query but but refresh the audience list within the meta ad that you select.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you find a query, let's say, and in the first week that it's live, you haven't updated it because you want to see how it performs, let's say, and it's blowing it out of the water.
**Jon Kluger:** You're killing.
**Jon Kluger:** You just go in here and you set this schedule.
**Jon Kluger:** And now that week, every week, every day, however often you want it set, you're automatically refreshing that list and moving away from the people whose intent has expired is what I look at as that reduces your cost because you're no longer targeting those who are no longer relevant, while improving your ability to capture someone in their initial instance of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** We found that to be incredibly, incredibly powerful and rewarding for our clients.
**Jon Kluger:** So that being said, that's just kind of the traditional one.
**Jon Kluger:** Through that we do the biggest breakdown that I'll say this is the pricing breakdown for a single license versus white label.
**Jon Kluger:** We're only looking at a single license for you.
**Jon Kluger:** All you need is a single license Right now, if you say you need additional pixels, we can easily, you know, we say it's 50 bucks for an additional one, you need one or two more, I got you.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't worry, I can make it happen.
**Jon Kluger:** But as I mentioned, the quarterly promotion is running I believe through the end of next week.
**Jon Kluger:** That would be $500 a month for three months paid upfront.
**Jon Kluger:** So it would be $1500 for all three months.
**Jon Kluger:** You're locked in, in that price for forever.
**Jon Kluger:** Every, in like every upgrade we do to V2, you're included.
**Jon Kluger:** Every upgrade and new feature we roll out, you're still paying $500.
**Jon Kluger:** So we want to reward our customers that joined us in the early days and that we're excited and we want you to be a lifelong partner of ours.
**Jon Kluger:** The dream scenario really is you start doing this so well, each and every one of your customers go, hey, I actually want a full like license or instance.
**Jon Kluger:** Then you can transition to a white label when it makes sense.
**Jon Kluger:** And there you have API included.
**Jon Kluger:** You get five per license and, and the cost per license drops depending on how many additional because each one after 10 is only $100.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can see like right here, it's 400, 365 or 300, let's say you add another 20 just for the sake.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll see the cost per license continues to reduce.
**Jon Kluger:** So you always have the option to switch over if that's something that you desire.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh no.
**Jon Kluger:** What happened?
**Jon Kluger:** There we go.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry.
**Jon Kluger:** If you desire, but I always recommend we start on this single license tab.

**Jodi Blank:** Yeah, of course.
**Jodi Blank:** So you're talking about if I white label, then a company could purchase like, like multiple licenses for themselves.
**Jodi Blank:** Is that what you mean?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, what I'm saying is like we would make this not say retarget iq.
**Jon Kluger:** It would be your brand and then every single one of your customers would have a login.
**Jon Kluger:** They could go in and they could see the platform itself, they could play around, they could explore, they could act.
**Jon Kluger:** You could actually essentially position this as, hey, these guys who I actually get this data from and this platform from on their website.
**Jon Kluger:** Because in a couple months when V2 comes out, we're increasing the public facing website.
**Jon Kluger:** It will say 750 for the quarter.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say you'll be able to say, listen guys, I work with these guys, they normally sell this for XYZ amount.
**Jon Kluger:** I have a deal with them since I've been working with them for a long time where I can actually set you up for 500 bucks instead of you going and paying 750.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, if you want a full managed offering where I'll also run the ads for you, it's 500 plus whatever you typically charge.
**Jon Kluger:** And then they will just be able to access the tool and use it for whatever they want.
**Jon Kluger:** Totally up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** I, like I said, easy thing for us to cross that bridge when we get there.
**Jon Kluger:** If I lock you in at this quarterly for V1, I honor the white label price that we discussed today for V2.
**Jon Kluger:** So if in six months from now you go, Jonathan, I want to use V2 and I want.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, you're already on B2, sorry Jonathan, I want to upgrade to white label, then it would still be these prices even if our public facing pricing was $1500 a month, what have you.

**Jodi Blank:** So what do you like this the service that I'm thinking, so let's just talk Facebook ads for a second and I realize I can use this for a lot more things, but what Normally, first of all, I'm thinking I'd be running ads for myself to probably get clients.
**Jodi Blank:** Right.

**Jon Kluger:** So that's why you're here.

**Jodi Blank:** Sorry, what?

**Jon Kluger:** That's why you're here?

**Jodi Blank:** Yeah.
**Jodi Blank:** So what do you, what would you charge?
**Jodi Blank:** If all I'm, if all I'm doing is going after companies that, you know, have an ads manager on their team and I'm just, just selling them data, what would you.

**Jon Kluger:** Bucks a month, how much?
**Jon Kluger:** 500.

**Jodi Blank:** 500.

**Jon Kluger:** And the reason for that is as long as we don't need it.
**Jon Kluger:** So on our back end, transparently, the more instances that we have and the more integrations we have, the more it costs us.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can make all the data pools that you want.
**Jon Kluger:** You can make a million data polls.
**Jon Kluger:** We joke that there's.
**Jon Kluger:** On the platform, you'll see on the audiences, sorry, you'll see it says 10,000 here.
**Jon Kluger:** That's just because we had to put a number.
**Jon Kluger:** If you can hit 10,000 audiences, I'll give you a million more.
**Jon Kluger:** I've literally never seen someone do it.
**Jon Kluger:** I had a guy on a call yesterday who said challenge accepted.
**Jon Kluger:** And I went, okay, go for it brother.
**Jon Kluger:** But literally all you would need to do is if you have a specific query or a specific search that you're on a daily, weekly, monthly basis updating your customer.
**Jon Kluger:** You just have that as that saved query each time it updates.
**Jon Kluger:** You just go in and you can download it and email it over to them and you're good to go.
**Jon Kluger:** Or if you are managing their ads, you can just send it over to the ad account and choose their specific campaign.
**Jon Kluger:** So you could have five different clients integrated for $0 extra on Meta because we understand in your flow that makes sense.
**Jon Kluger:** That's how we're positioned.
**Jon Kluger:** Our two founders are marketing desk.
**Jon Kluger:** They have their own agencies.
**Jon Kluger:** Alex had his own agency and Nate, the other founder did too.
**Jon Kluger:** They both scaled those down but they built this in in with agencies in mind.
**Jon Kluger:** Now if you're someone who's an agency that likes what whiteweight, white labeling, which there's plenty of out there, that's where we have this offering for you.
**Jon Kluger:** All you need is the single license.

**Jodi Blank:** Okay, what about how is the training?
**Jodi Blank:** How is like Absolutely.

**Jon Kluger:** So right now we have an onboarding video and we provide 24 hour support.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll set up a slack channel for you.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have any issues along the way, you create take a loom video or screen recording, tell us exactly what the issue is, we'll come back with a video that explains it, explains the best thing to do and gives you the hands on guidance.
**Jon Kluger:** In V2 we're going to have a robust demo environment, guides, use cases, everything and anything you can imagine.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason that it's not available currently is I was asking the tech team, they said we can take time to make these videos or we can take time to make sure V2 is live as soon as possible.
**Jon Kluger:** You choose.
**Jon Kluger:** And I went V2 and they said when V2 is live we will have these videos because we're literally making them as we're building the platform.
**Jon Kluger:** And I said perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** So in the short term we will be there, we will be giving support.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want white glove support, which is anyone will come on a call, give you a hands on support, do everything with you.
**Jon Kluger:** That's additionally a 249amonth.
**Jon Kluger:** What I just tell everyone is don't start with it, see if everything is good, seeing it, see how you're going and if you decide, hey, I actually need this, I can always add it.
**Jon Kluger:** And the reason I say that is two months of white glove support is one month of license access.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't want you to be six months in saying I've never used this white glove and I could have three more months of this license.
**Jon Kluger:** What the hell, I don't like that.
**Jon Kluger:** I am not an overseller.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't care about throwing a bunch of add ons or upsells to you unless they make sense.

**Jodi Blank:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Any additional questions?

**Jodi Blank:** No, I think that's it.

**Jon Kluger:** So you don't have to do it right now.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm just going to let you know Payment super easy.
**Jon Kluger:** Just a strike link.
**Jon Kluger:** If you choose that you want to say, split up the payment over three months, you can actually use Clarina.
**Jon Kluger:** And the really funny, the really cool part is if you use Clarina, you're saving $250 every single month by being on the quarterly.
**Jon Kluger:** The clarinet fee is about 40 bucks.
**Jon Kluger:** So even if you wanted to pay on a month to month, but lock in the quarterly pricing, you've literally just.
**Jon Kluger:** You'd be saving $200 by doing that, even if you're using it through clarity.

**Jodi Blank:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** So super duper easy.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll drop this in the chat.
**Jon Kluger:** Feel free.
**Jon Kluger:** All you need to do, once you make a purchase, when you partner with us, which I would hope, I would hope, all you have to do is email me.
**Jon Kluger:** It is, you know, I'll send you a follow up after this.

**Jodi Blank:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** You also get an email from the Firefly.
**Jon Kluger:** The Firefly will say it's from Alex because he originally was the manager of the meeting and then I stepped in.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me.
**Jon Kluger:** You just send an email to me, say, jonathan, I paid.
**Jon Kluger:** I get an alert through Slack anyways.
**Jon Kluger:** But on the off chance that you do it under your business name or you do it under a different name or what have you, just let me know.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll loop in Sydney, our onboarding specialist.
**Jon Kluger:** Sydney will then have your credentials created within 24 hours, provide you with your onboarding.
**Jon Kluger:** And then I'll go ahead and have that Slack channel set up and you'll easily be able to communicate with us whenever, about whatever, and we can be there to support you along the way.

**Jodi Blank:** Okay.
**Jodi Blank:** Okay.
**Jodi Blank:** So let's say I start and I want to.
**Jodi Blank:** I get a client right off the bat and I want to set their meta meta ads up.
**Jodi Blank:** Is there a specific training for that right now or how do I figure out how to do that?

**Jon Kluger:** If you need a video of that, I can just ask.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm sure we have one that we've sent to someone else.
**Jon Kluger:** I just have to check.
**Jon Kluger:** We were having like a library of guides for you and everything and anything that you could think of with C2 right now, the organization of where those videos live and all of that is more of us sending them around to each other and then passing them along.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you need that video or if you need that support, I can easily ask Alex.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm sure Alex can either A, has one handy or B, he'll just make one right away.
**Jon Kluger:** Like it's, it's super easy in that regard.

**Jodi Blank:** Okay.
**Jodi Blank:** Okay, great.
**Jodi Blank:** Well, I.
**Jodi Blank:** It's definitely you know, I'm thinking about it.

**Jon Kluger:** Um, my only ask is if you decide either to move along with us or with another partner, just let me know.
**Jon Kluger:** Otherwise you're going to get a bunch of emails from me and you might get a text message from me and you might get much more follow ups than you might want.
**Jon Kluger:** So just let me know so I can make a note and I can say your intent has now passed.
**Jon Kluger:** No.
**Jon Kluger:** And from there, you know, hopefully.
**Jon Kluger:** What?
**Jon Kluger:** You choose us.
**Jon Kluger:** But if not, you know, best of luck.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, I'm not.
**Jon Kluger:** There's no ill will here.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not, we're not out here like, you know, being me.
**Jon Kluger:** But, you know, we'd love for you to join the team, we'd love for you to be an early adopter and we'd love to help you and your business grow with data.

**Jodi Blank:** Awesome.
**Jodi Blank:** Well, I appreciate the time.
**Jodi Blank:** Thanks so much.

**Jon Kluger:** Thank you, Jody.
**Jon Kluger:** Look forward to hearing back.

**Jodi Blank:** Okay, bye.
**Jodi Blank:** Bye.

**Jon Kluger:** Bye.
