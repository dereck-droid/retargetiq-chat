## Transcript

**Jon Kluger:** If you need to show anyone on the team, feel free to distribute it.
**Jon Kluger:** If at any point you have a secret to tell, let me know.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll kick the guy out.

**Ben Ijah:** Sounds good.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** I would say that for the most part we're looking for both.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** So we're looking at Audience Lab right now, two fold.
**Ben Ijah:** Both to find more clients for ourself and then also to basically be able to leverage that intent data for our clients.
**Ben Ijah:** So we currently have a global database of over 3 billion people globally and we've got a lot of information on them, but we do not have intent data.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** Basically all we're able to provide is just like icp, targeting demographics, geographic, stuff like that.
**Ben Ijah:** So wanted to be able to offer the intent data.
**Ben Ijah:** That's the primary thing that we're looking for.
**Ben Ijah:** Now the way we want to be able to access that data is solely programmatically.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** So we want to be able to leverage the API to basically be able to pass around information as needed.
**Ben Ijah:** So yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** And then again so for us internally and then also for clients now do.

**Jon Kluger:** You want to be reselling this, this, this access in this platform as essentially a white label or do you just want to essentially say, hey guys, I'm working with a new data provider.
**Jon Kluger:** We're going to be able to use an API call to just instantly go into your data and optimize it based off of a call, or do you want them to essentially be able to discover additional intent, intent topics, etc.
**Jon Kluger:** And do some of their own self discovery?
**Jon Kluger:** Just for my understanding.

**Ben Ijah:** Great question.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, definitely white labeling and kind of so the way that our platform works specifically, and I'm more so thinking of this specifically for Outbound, which is our new platform that basically allows people.
**Ben Ijah:** Because what we've done in the past is.
**Ben Ijah:** And you went to the site, so you saw Campaign Autopilot.
**Ben Ijah:** What we did with that was kind of a hybrid approach where we actually had like our team setting up like custom AI models for each user and whatnot.
**Ben Ijah:** Much more involved process, a much more costly process as well.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** So for that we're looking at like 4,500 for the setup and then the actual ongoing monthly fee varied based off of volume.
**Ben Ijah:** What we've actually created is kind of like a revamped version of that with Outbound, which essentially allows people to go in and set up their own campaigns.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** So basically the way that we would use this is everything on the front end for a user would essentially stay the same.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** They're going through setting up their campaigns the only difference is now, whereas before, there's basically a targeting helper that's just like an AI chat that allows users to basically communicate with the AI to figure out like what their ICP targeting would be.
**Ben Ijah:** So basically the only difference would be that in that targeting setup, we're actually not just figuring out how to kind of query our database, we're basically figuring out how the API call would be set up for retargetiq.

**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** I appreciate that explanation.
**Jon Kluger:** That's perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** To give you a little bit more context about me.
**Jon Kluger:** So I am the CRO here at retargetiq.
**Jon Kluger:** I like to imagine I was a co founder, but I was two weeks too late.
**Jon Kluger:** But hey, neither here nor there.
**Jon Kluger:** Reason I'm part of this organization has to do exactly with my background.
**Jon Kluger:** I spent the last eight years working at various data and AI companies before AI was cool, I like to say, some of which are worth a billion plus, some of which are much smaller.
**Jon Kluger:** And I've been building out sales organizations, been leading the sales teams at each and every one of those for almost a decade.
**Jon Kluger:** What's really beautiful about this is I went to school specifically for data analytics.
**Jon Kluger:** What I mean that as in is yes, I'm a sales guy, but I understand exactly what you're referring to.
**Jon Kluger:** I am a tech guy at heart.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm just too lazy to sit there and keep up to date with code.
**Jon Kluger:** I clock code is my best friend, let me put it that way.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm constantly building things because I know how to prompt, I know how to communicate, I know how to build it, I know what needs to plug into what.
**Jon Kluger:** I just have a lot of typos.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** What I always tell my, my coding friends, I was like, my engineer friends, I'm like, you guys literally can't spell anything but like what the language you need to use every day to code.
**Jon Kluger:** And they're like, yeah, that's fair.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was like, yeah, you misspell commission because you don't make them.
**Jon Kluger:** And they're like, yeah, that's fair.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, I'm going to talk through this in a way where if you need to explain your workflow currently in any more depth, don't hesitate, I will understand.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't think I'm just some dude who doesn't understand.
**Jon Kluger:** With that being said, how we operate theoretically, if you were just pulling an API and you just need the API pull, you could theoretically get a single license from us and use opt in the API, which would probably run you close to about a thousand bucks.
**Jon Kluger:** A month and charge everyone however much you want.
**Jon Kluger:** The thing about that is the tool will be branded Retarget iq.
**Jon Kluger:** It won't be white labeled, it won't be separate instances.
**Jon Kluger:** This would just suffice to your need of the API call.
**Jon Kluger:** We have a white label option.
**Jon Kluger:** It comes standard with 10, 10 licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** Each license comes with the API.
**Jon Kluger:** It's branded to your brand.
**Jon Kluger:** And each license average cost is about $400.
**Jon Kluger:** After that initial 10, everything after that is 100 bucks.
**Jon Kluger:** What this allows for is it allows for direct integrations, which I know you might not need them, but it allows for direct integrations into CRMs, AD spaces.
**Jon Kluger:** So Google Meta as well as you can even do direct mail through our platform based off of website visitors.
**Jon Kluger:** So not only are we the intent database that we are, which by the way, the person we partner with to get our data supplies data to all Fortune 100 companies.
**Jon Kluger:** What I can tell you right now is none of our competitors have access to our top tier level of data.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is our technical co founder worked with this data broker for 15 years building out this data set, building out the SQL query and the calls and the ability to properly identify and accumulate this data.
**Jon Kluger:** And after 15 years of working with them and generating them God knows how much money, they finally said, all right, as a thank you, we will give you one of three people globally to be allowed to license our data.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only are we using this core data set, we take an additional 200 data sets that we waterfall enrich to fill in any gaps.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I like to highlight this is we have competitors in the space that like to make claims that, you know, they're different.
**Jon Kluger:** We truly can make that claim because we don't use the core data set that so many of our competitors use because we wanted to go a step beyond.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we set no limitations to you.
**Jon Kluger:** You want to build 50,000 audiences, go for it.
**Jon Kluger:** You want to download 10 billion records, go for it.
**Jon Kluger:** My only ask is don't send more than 3,000 API calls in a second.
**Jon Kluger:** Because that's what we're tested to.
**Jon Kluger:** If you can exceed that, we'll have to talk.
**Jon Kluger:** My, my, my tech guy might be like, why do they need that many calls in that in a second if they split it up?

**Ben Ijah:** So we're in batch stuff as well, so that's fine.

**Jon Kluger:** It's not a huge thing.
**Jon Kluger:** I mean I've never seen someone do 3000 API calls in a second.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you can, I kind of want to see it because I'd Be impressed, but neither here nor there.
**Jon Kluger:** When we look at the white label, that is going to be the opportunity, a very nice opportunity for you.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that, if you want to allow your users or your customers to even go in and play with the platform, learn about intent, learn about what you need when it comes to point in tech topics.
**Jon Kluger:** Because people a lot of the time will overload the intent filters on things like Audience Lab where they're adding 15 things, but only one of those things is the genuine thing they're looking for.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, so with our tool you can have unlimited audiences, unlimited polls, you can update it however often you want, be it daily, weekly, monthly.
**Jon Kluger:** You can even have it scheduled to be sent to your ad platforms directly over where we have over a 90% match rate with our SHA256.

**Ben Ijah:** And you're saying we're able to do that via API?

**Jon Kluger:** You can do it API.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, the pushover and all of that.
**Jon Kluger:** We have direct integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** You can do it through the platform too, if you want to do it through direct API.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we can bring over the data, the documentation here.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll just send it to you.
**Jon Kluger:** Before I forget, why do you keep doing this?
**Jon Kluger:** There we go.

**Ben Ijah:** And the only reason I asked is just because I know what you were.
**Ben Ijah:** I know when you were speaking about the different features earlier, you brought that up with the license version where you've got the different seats, but not with the API version.

**Jon Kluger:** So I just wanted to show the white label comes with API included for every single account.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason that I always, if you're going to want to have it white labeled, where you're actually selling this as an added service or added feature.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that is because it makes it a lot cleaner in terms of communication, record keeping, connectors and all of that.
**Jon Kluger:** Because you want to make sure if you're feeding in one API into one account, there isn't the possibility that they get crossed over and now chaos ensues with the API associated with an individual account already available or direct integration to CRM available.
**Jon Kluger:** Do you use like go high level?
**Jon Kluger:** Which CRM do you typically use?

**Ben Ijah:** So we've got our own.
**Ben Ijah:** We've got basically everything in house.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay then AGI is the way to go.
**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** What it will just allow for is it just allows to kind of isolate it and make it a little bit cleaner.
**Jon Kluger:** You can also push it to meta directly, Google Ads directly.
**Jon Kluger:** We're working tab.
**Jon Kluger:** So V2 will be live February.
**Jon Kluger:** Will be live February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** The promotion that we have right now is if you purchase V1, you are grandfathered in at V1 prices.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that is we are most likely doubling our price.
**Jon Kluger:** Why I say that is if you white label with us, you can literally point to our website and you already would be essentially at profit.
**Jon Kluger:** Because the quarterly with an API is $750 on the website right now.
**Jon Kluger:** If you were to look at it in three weeks, it will be closer to probably like 1350 or $1000.
**Jon Kluger:** Why I mentioned that is you're getting the relative value at 400 bucks a license, and any license after the first 10 is 100.
**Jon Kluger:** So just by having the tool, you can turn around and say, I'm saving you, I'm charging you $100 less than they have it posted, or I'm giving you the API for free.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say it's a $600 difference.
**Jon Kluger:** You're looking at $7200 in profit per white label account.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's why I just kind of break that down.
**Jon Kluger:** I've got a sheet that we can go through.
**Jon Kluger:** Once I show you the demo, that will break down pricing and everything like that.
**Jon Kluger:** Once you have a little bit of better visual.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, do you use super pixels for your clients?

**Ben Ijah:** No.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** So typically everything we do right now is basically just taking the data that we have and we've got like a lot of analytics and everything like that tied to like actual campaigns, but we're not using any pixels right now on the sites.
**Ben Ijah:** I know you brought up being able to like capture site visitors.

**Jon Kluger:** So with every single license, we include five super pixels, so that's included in the cost.
**Jon Kluger:** You're good to go, what that includes.
**Jon Kluger:** So say if we do one license and you want to have a super pixel for every single one of your customers, we can do a single license with the API and however many pixels you need if you want to add that.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you have a white label and it comes with 10 licenses, just think you basically have 50 pixels.
**Jon Kluger:** Any additional license, another five.
**Jon Kluger:** What these pixels are able to capture, depending on the cookie permissions of each website, we're able to capture between 40 to 60, 70% of visitors without them entering any personal information.
**Jon Kluger:** What I mean by this is we can identify the top pages, top sources, and top cities if you have a geographically specific client where they have physical locations.
**Jon Kluger:** I love this feature because I love my non data people, but sometimes they just need to see it in a heat map in front of them.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, if you look at Dallas, for instance, it's Dallas Fort Worth.
**Jon Kluger:** It Looks like a single heat map, but as we bring in will actually distribute it based off of a larger or a more granular look.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you're an auto repair shop in Dallas and you want to expand your business so you want to get more traffic.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, what we could look at this heat map and conduce is, okay, we need to tighten up our ad area if we want to concentrate it more into Dallas proper.
**Jon Kluger:** Or maybe it might make sense for us to open another location in Fort Worth.
**Jon Kluger:** So all of this information is gathered from the super pixel.
**Jon Kluger:** On the analytics side, it looks like this, like I said, V2 will be a lot sexier.
**Jon Kluger:** More features.
**Jon Kluger:** You can break down your audience by gender, age, income, traffic source, and even the device type.
**Jon Kluger:** There'll be more accurate later.
**Jon Kluger:** And what this information looks like, what you'll see on the top is you'll see that person's contact information.
**Jon Kluger:** We always are able to capture their mailing address, which is beautiful.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, if we scroll on over, you'll be able to track some of the user path of where they're going, what they click on, what they look at.
**Jon Kluger:** And then you can actually see deep information in terms of financials, location, contact information, device ID behaviors, the vehicles they own, and even the properties that they own.
**Jon Kluger:** So these are all fields that will be included in the intent.
**Jon Kluger:** I just like to highlight that even if they just land on your page and you don't know who they are, we're able to capture this information regardless.

**Ben Ijah:** That's awesome.
**Ben Ijah:** So you guys are actually the first platform that I've seen have any kind of analytics.
**Ben Ijah:** Is that information also accessible via the API?

**Jon Kluger:** Let me double check on that.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** If I'm being bond, I've got to ask our tech lead, our technical co founder, if it's something that you need and we're going to be sizable partners, I can have it built for you.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Pretty easy in that regard.
**Jon Kluger:** What I like to say is you're.
**Jon Kluger:** You're joining us at v1.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're joining at v1, you have direct voice into v2, v3, v4, v5.
**Jon Kluger:** Because at the end of the day, we are here to serve you.
**Jon Kluger:** And we don't want to be like someone else who we mentioned in our ad, who has told their clients that for the last nine months they're going to build a Google Ads integration.
**Jon Kluger:** And we've switched over six clients in the last two days because they're just fed up.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** We are a nitty gritty small team because we don't want to have someone under our umbrella who's overpromising and under delivering.
**Jon Kluger:** Like to hear, hey listen man, I've been on the other side, I've been on the other side of the table numerous times and I've been disappointed.
**Jon Kluger:** I, I vowed to the team, I was like, if I'm doing this, I'm gonna be honest, I'm gonna be blunt, and I'm not not gonna both show people if I have to tell someone they only need to spend a thousand instead of 10,000, that's what's gonna happen.
**Jon Kluger:** Because I don't want you being like, why the hell am I paying for this?
**Jon Kluger:** Like I'm not using this feature.
**Jon Kluger:** Then you're upset and instead of you recommending us to a friend, you go, those guys rip me off.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't like those guys.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not good business.
**Jon Kluger:** My grandfather had a shoe company that he started from nothing.
**Jon Kluger:** He would fly to China, he'd literally sell it to like warehouse stores in the US in the 60s.
**Jon Kluger:** He literally made nowadays what's the equivalent of a multi million dollar deal with a handshake.
**Jon Kluger:** That's the man who taught me how to sell.
**Jon Kluger:** That's the man who taught me how to do business.
**Jon Kluger:** And if I can't look you in the eye and feel confident in what I'm doing is right, then I shouldn't be doing it now.
**Jon Kluger:** Additionally, one of the features we have is we can actually create triggers.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say we have a trigger for someone landed on a Contact Us page but they didn't fill out the form.
**Jon Kluger:** You can actually use this as a trigger for direct mail.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to partner with us, do that.
**Jon Kluger:** It's about $0.90% with postage.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to do it elsewhere, that's perfectly fine.
**Jon Kluger:** What I would recommend is on the visitor identification, pull this in via API.
**Jon Kluger:** Essentially have it into your CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** You can have it say a true false the true.
**Jon Kluger:** If they exist already, which means now they're a website visitor.
**Jon Kluger:** Before you send the automatic mail, you then wait to see if they execute on a form.
**Jon Kluger:** It could be 24 hours, could be however long you want.
**Jon Kluger:** If they don't submit the form, then create a trigger that sends them to a direct mail.

**Ben Ijah:** So what kind of control do you have over direct mail?
**Ben Ijah:** Right, because that's actually something we've been looking at too.
**Ben Ijah:** But one, the cost varies a lot, right?
**Ben Ijah:** So for you guys to have that 90 cents per, you guys are obviously doing some volume now with that too.
**Ben Ijah:** The content varies A lot.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** Like there's some platforms or some places where you can basically like send in almost like a, like a swag pack right to where they warehouse it for you.
**Ben Ijah:** And then whenever you need it shipped out, there can.

**Jon Kluger:** There's a transparency.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now it's primarily just postcards or infographics depending on the size.
**Jon Kluger:** They can be sick 4 by 6 or 6 by 9, depending on what you're feeling.
**Jon Kluger:** This works really well for our partners who are in the the service retail space or the retail services, be it roofers, be it auto mechanic shops, real estate agents, all of the different things where you want to essentially remain top of mind.
**Jon Kluger:** Or if you're say a auto mechanic shop, you can literally throw on a $10 off oil change and just have it go to them.
**Jon Kluger:** Another really great part.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll dive into this a little bit more when we start building out audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** But I literally work with partners who are roofers who will go and pull an intent list based off of roofing in a very specific either zip code or city, whatever it might be.
**Jon Kluger:** And anyone that comes in with a high intent, they filter, they take that list, they upload it to chat GPT and they say, give me a knocking path.
**Jon Kluger:** When they literally go driving around for an hour or two hours and knock on the doors of the people that show very high signals for intent, they look at their roof, they see a missing shingle, they ring the doorbell and they go, I was in the neighborhood.
**Jon Kluger:** I couldn't help but notice it looks like there's a little damage to your roof.
**Jon Kluger:** I do free quotes.
**Jon Kluger:** You know, I was working at the neighbors down the street.
**Jon Kluger:** Would you mind if I went up, climbed up on your roof, take a look at your, your, your flats or your whatever, shingles and then I can give you an idea of how much something like this might cost.
**Jon Kluger:** And they'll probably his exact quotas.
**Jon Kluger:** They say to you, how'd you know I needed this?
**Jon Kluger:** I actually scheduled an appointment for like next week to have somebody come out.
**Jon Kluger:** But now that you're here, this is like state.
**Jon Kluger:** Yes, it's just intent on me.

**Ben Ijah:** So, you know, a question for you too then, because I see you have like an image upload.
**Ben Ijah:** Are you able to actually like customize like the content on there or is it like you're uploading a standard image for each?

**Jon Kluger:** Uploading a standard.
**Jon Kluger:** But what I can do is if you guys haven't, if you guys are going to send a lot of like, let me put it this way, if you guys have a high volume of anything.
**Jon Kluger:** We are always open to the conversation of how can we make it work for you.
**Jon Kluger:** Because at the end of the day, like we don't do the physical mail ourselves.
**Jon Kluger:** We have a partner that we work with that we've arranged deal where we get a preferred price because we're bringing them essentially customers.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So if it boils down to we need to work something out, we need to go, you guys are sending a million pieces of mail a week, which that would be awesome.
**Jon Kluger:** If we need to look at pricing, if we need to look at anything like that, that's something that we can always have a conversation when we cross that bridge.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, one thing to highlight.
**Jon Kluger:** Like before you have these integrations, if you wanted to connect into Meta Connector, you can connect to as many meta accounts as you'd like.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to connect into CRM, which you don't have to, we won't even worry about it in terms of additional outreaches.
**Jon Kluger:** You can even have it plugged in Slack.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to send yourself a note every time a query updated to push the new data over, you could even send yourself a little Slack note and says, hey, so and so's data just updated however you'd like.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, now here comes the fun part.
**Jon Kluger:** What I'm sure you're here for.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** First thing I want to highlight is the fact that here I'll pull a little section for you.
**Jon Kluger:** This was two days ago.
**Jon Kluger:** In the span of three hours, we pulled 3.5 million leads.
**Jon Kluger:** This is a real account.
**Jon Kluger:** This is a customer's account.
**Jon Kluger:** He's just super cool with us and he's like, go ahead and play on it.
**Jon Kluger:** I have everything set up.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't need.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't need anything like that.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I say that is I like to demonstrate that there are no limitations.
**Jon Kluger:** Some of our competitors will charge you by credit.
**Jon Kluger:** Some of our competitors will charge you and limit you to your audience size.
**Jon Kluger:** Some of our competitors will limit you to the number of audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** But as I said before, I come from the data background.
**Jon Kluger:** I pushed the team and I made it very clear that we need to have this set up to allow for you to test, experiment, look at different filters, be able to pull very specific lists.
**Jon Kluger:** Because how else are you going to learn and improve?
**Jon Kluger:** If I tell you you can only use first four audiences forever or you have to pay me XYZ more for each and every single one, how are you ever going to improve?
**Jon Kluger:** For every statistical study, you need a control group and an experimental.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** If you're stuck with the control group for a year.
**Jon Kluger:** How are you going to test and do better?
**Jon Kluger:** So like I said, I'm here fighting for you guys because I've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years for data enrichment tools.
**Jon Kluger:** That pissed me the hell off.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, that's a great call out.
**Ben Ijah:** It's a great call out.
**Ben Ijah:** I was actually speaking to somebody today.
**Ben Ijah:** So I've got a client that I'm basically using to just front the cost for all of this.
**Ben Ijah:** And we were talking today and that was one of his biggest concerns is not being able to get the ability to.
**Ben Ijah:** He wanted to, I think, go through.
**Ben Ijah:** He just wanted to see like, like 10 leads or something like that off there to, to basically see and make sure like the data is what they're saying it is.
**Ben Ijah:** That's a great call out.

**Jon Kluger:** I appreciate it.
**Jon Kluger:** I can send you a testimonial that we got from one of my clients.
**Jon Kluger:** We were actually on with them yesterday.
**Jon Kluger:** They spent six figures in meta ads a month.
**Jon Kluger:** They've halved their cost and doubled their click through and conversion rate.
**Jon Kluger:** Wow.
**Jon Kluger:** Just by using us to actually properly target intent into flush out the old list every week.
**Jon Kluger:** Because at the end of the day I explained to people intent is a buying sign.
**Jon Kluger:** If I'm looking to buy.
**Jon Kluger:** If I'm looking to get auto repair, I'm not going to sit around for a month knowing that my car won't start.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm gonna make a high intent decision within 24 to 48 hours and get it done.
**Jon Kluger:** So being able to generate massive amounts of data and recall a query every time we call a query, we're not necessarily just showing you the net news, just to be clear, we're showing you everyone that still has intent.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you have some person that has taken a really long time to make a decision, they'll continuously show up as having intent unless all of a sudden they make their purchase and drop off.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay, so how are you guys determining if they make that purchase?

**Jon Kluger:** Their intent disappears.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay, okay, that makes sense.
**Ben Ijah:** So let me ask you this too.
**Ben Ijah:** So as far as like the attack goes, how large are we able to like adjust the window or do you guys have something in the back?

**Jon Kluger:** We do up to two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't do beyond two weeks.

**Ben Ijah:** We're able to adjust it.

**Jon Kluger:** You can do 24 hours, you can do 48 hours, you could do six days, four days, whatever you want.
**Jon Kluger:** Two weeks is our cap.
**Jon Kluger:** Because we, we want, I hate to say this, we want to idiot proof it for some people because some people are Going to try to pull up last month, the last year, the last everything, and then they're going to go spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on Meta and then come to us and be like, why isn't it working?

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** And we go, well, are you hitting people with high intent, or are you just hitting people that had intent at some point?

**Ben Ijah:** Gotcha.
**Ben Ijah:** So run me through.
**Ben Ijah:** So if we're calling it 24 hours, right?
**Ben Ijah:** So that's someone that could have had intent over the last.
**Ben Ijah:** Let's call it month.
**Ben Ijah:** But they've also expressed intent in the last 24 hours.

**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** And then if you pull up the next day and they aren't showing intent anymore, they probably made their purchase.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay, cool.

**Jon Kluger:** In terms of our intent rating, because we'll dive into that next.
**Jon Kluger:** We have low, medium, high.
**Jon Kluger:** I like to break down like this.
**Jon Kluger:** Low is a B grade where you're okay with it, you're not upset, like, you could do better.
**Jon Kluger:** Medium is an A where you're like, yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** And then high is an A plus, where you're like, holy shit, I need to be like, knocking on that person's door to celebrate that sort of vibe as intent.
**Jon Kluger:** It is true intent.
**Jon Kluger:** And what I mean that is in.
**Jon Kluger:** I have a nephew, love the kid to death.
**Jon Kluger:** Sometimes I need five minutes to distract him.
**Jon Kluger:** So I hand him my phone and I put on cocoa milk.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not showing intent for cocoa milk.

**Ben Ijah:** Gotcha.

**Jon Kluger:** So we don't want to just look at your Internet behavior and just say you googled one thing once.
**Jon Kluger:** No, we look at consistent behavior patterns.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Now what we're seeing in V1 right now is different than V2.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll be very transparent.
**Jon Kluger:** V1, you have to pick off of our intent list.
**Jon Kluger:** V2 will have a free form text box.
**Jon Kluger:** Just be aware of that.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, I do not recommend you can in V2, but me personally, I do not recommend adding additional topics beyond the 1.
**Jon Kluger:** You can always create a whole new audience with different ones to test them.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is if there's an overlap between the two terms, it doesn't suddenly make it from a low intent to a medium.
**Jon Kluger:** It's just looking at the individual topics and analyzing those.
**Jon Kluger:** I always like to highlight that because some people will go in here and throw in 15 different things in the 14th and 15th, they're like, that's better.
**Jon Kluger:** Bad.
**Jon Kluger:** Because now you're skewing outside of icp.
**Jon Kluger:** Now you're skewing outside of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** You're literally just putting in terms to put in terms to Build the list.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Now, advanced search is our boolean.
**Jon Kluger:** No intent.
**Jon Kluger:** Just give me CEOs the fortune of.
**Jon Kluger:** Of medical companies that have over 10 employees and are located in Texas.
**Jon Kluger:** That is what advanced search is for.
**Jon Kluger:** No intent topic B2C is end consumer roofing services.
**Jon Kluger:** Gucci even.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, it can span from a physical good to a service to whatever you think someone would buy for themselves.
**Jon Kluger:** B2B, we look at purchasing on behalf.
**Jon Kluger:** So, like, if you are, let's pretend you're a CRM and could put in Salesforce and you could be looking for everyone who looks for Salesforce and target them.
**Jon Kluger:** Almost like how we got you here today.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** And looking at audience lab and said, hey, here's our message.
**Jon Kluger:** Come check us out.
**Jon Kluger:** That's how I differentiate between B2B and B2C.
**Jon Kluger:** Is there a specific one you want to take a look at?
**Jon Kluger:** We can do B2C.
**Jon Kluger:** It would probably be most likely for your customers.
**Jon Kluger:** Would that be correct?
**Jon Kluger:** Or are they more B2B?

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, I would.
**Ben Ijah:** So let's.
**Ben Ijah:** Let's look at a few.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** So I think obviously when it comes to, like, home services and whatnot, like, you guys clearly have that stuff.
**Ben Ijah:** I'm going to hit you with one that's a little bit more complicated.
**Ben Ijah:** We just closed a deal with a celebrity bourbon brand.
**Ben Ijah:** So.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** So how would you guys handle something like that?
**Ben Ijah:** What's that?

**Jon Kluger:** I'm a big bourbon guy, so you've got my attention.
**Jon Kluger:** Do I get to know which bourbon?

**Ben Ijah:** Let's.
**Ben Ijah:** Let's keep it addressed right now.
**Ben Ijah:** But yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Is it good?
**Jon Kluger:** Have you tried it?

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, it's great.
**Ben Ijah:** It's great.

**Jon Kluger:** Does he say, all right, all right, all right?

**Ben Ijah:** No.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, So we can do bourbon right off the bat.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.
**Ben Ijah:** So when I say celebrity, I also mean a pro athlete.
**Ben Ijah:** So are you able to.
**Ben Ijah:** Would that be like a combination that you'd recommend being bourbon and say let's.

**Jon Kluger:** That sports team and V2?
**Jon Kluger:** Yes, you could do that.
**Jon Kluger:** The thing is, is it looks for iterations of keywords based off of the two core words that you might provide.
**Jon Kluger:** So an instance like this, I would just put their name, their team name plus bourbon, like any iteration that someone could have and include the bourbon.
**Jon Kluger:** Because if you don't include the word bourbon, what's going to happen is it's just going to start looking at the people that are fan growing over them themselves.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a target you want.
**Jon Kluger:** Go for it.
**Jon Kluger:** But like having those phrases stacked in terms of.
**Jon Kluger:** In the V2 platform where we can do free form, anyone Anything.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what I would recommend.

**Ben Ijah:** So how would you.
**Ben Ijah:** How would you stack that?
**Ben Ijah:** So you'd put both in there.
**Ben Ijah:** So let's go off what you said.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** The celebrity name.

**Jon Kluger:** I would be like, celebrity name bourbon.
**Jon Kluger:** The next one, New York Yankees bourbon.
**Jon Kluger:** Or like just think about how people would Google it if they needed to find it and then essentially what that allows for.
**Jon Kluger:** So it allows for us to identify essentially common terms and searches that are used and behaviors associated with those searches.
**Jon Kluger:** And then we take that and we look across our data set.

**Ben Ijah:** So let's use that for an example then.

**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**Ben Ijah:** You said New York Yankees bourbon.
**Ben Ijah:** Let's throw that in there and see what kind of.

**Jon Kluger:** I can't do custom keywords right now for the next week and a half.
**Jon Kluger:** So what we could do for this one is like, let's take an example.
**Jon Kluger:** We could do urban.
**Jon Kluger:** I would add a rule.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say state.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's do New York in.

**Ben Ijah:** Gotcha.
**Ben Ijah:** That makes sense.

**Jon Kluger:** New York.
**Jon Kluger:** And we're also going to add a rule regarding 21 bucks.
**Jon Kluger:** Yep.
**Jon Kluger:** H, say N. We can do 18 to 24, but that might have you with.
**Jon Kluger:** In.
**Jon Kluger:** In V2, you'll be able to say 21 as the minimum.
**Jon Kluger:** Just to be clear, like I said before, we tried to idio proof this for our first couple customers so they wouldn't get upset if they did.
**Jon Kluger:** It's easier to blame everyone else than take responsibility is what we've learned.

**Ben Ijah:** So now when you're checking the.
**Ben Ijah:** When you're checking the.

**Jon Kluger:** The.

**Ben Ijah:** Your delicious.
**Ben Ijah:** Covering it, but to the left.
**Ben Ijah:** So the event date.
**Ben Ijah:** So when you're setting the event date.

**Jon Kluger:** That'S the window of intent.

**Ben Ijah:** So if you were to just put it for the last 24 hours and it's going to automatically know we only want a event date window of 24.

**Jon Kluger:** Hours moving forward as well, right?
**Jon Kluger:** Yep.
**Jon Kluger:** Once we build this audience, we'll save the query.
**Jon Kluger:** Then you can schedule that query to refresh however you want.
**Jon Kluger:** You can schedule it sent to your ad accounts whenever you want.
**Jon Kluger:** You can just schedule it out that way.
**Jon Kluger:** Super duper easy.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so are there any other fields that we want to add besides bourbon fans in New York between the illegal age of drinking, do you want a certain income level?

**Ben Ijah:** Not really.
**Ben Ijah:** And not really.
**Ben Ijah:** Are we able to see if someone's a drinker, for instance, or is that gonna.

**Jon Kluger:** Not right now, but I mean I can ask way that our tech team.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll ask them if they have a recommended way to address that because it could be a value that we have.
**Jon Kluger:** I just have to check on the back end.

**Ben Ijah:** Cool.
**Ben Ijah:** Cool.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, I mean, with that too.
**Ben Ijah:** Like, if there's some way that you guys are able to hand it handle it, we actually close a deal with.
**Ben Ijah:** It's like a holding company for liquor brands.
**Ben Ijah:** We're starting with the one that I'm mentioning, but there's nine other ones as well.
**Ben Ijah:** So if that's something we're able to use and leverage in advertising in a way that we were able to get like a decent return on.
**Ben Ijah:** Like, this is a company that's got access to some pockets to.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** So I'm going to run this query while we're doing this, I'm going to build another one because I have an idea to test something.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Ben Ijah:** Jack Daniels.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** I was thinking if we go on one of these, if we have it.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't have it right now.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have specific brands or specific things that you want to work.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so we have retail fashion, but.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, I'll look into if we can add.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to say, hey, here's our top 10 competitors for bourbon.
**Jon Kluger:** And send me over that.
**Jon Kluger:** I can, I can talk.
**Jon Kluger:** I can work on arranging that to be in tech categories.

**Ben Ijah:** I'll have to spend some time to figure out the overlap because I actually had it for the Jack Daniels specifically.
**Ben Ijah:** I was speaking to the team about that and they were thinking that from a product standpoint, it's a competitor, but from a target market standpoint, it's probably not the best competitor.

**Jon Kluger:** That's fair.
**Jon Kluger:** My thought that I would just have is taking a smaller segment of that to test.
**Jon Kluger:** Put it Jack Daniels.
**Jon Kluger:** And then why drink Jack when you're a fan of the Yankees, if it's a New York Yankees team?
**Jon Kluger:** And literally then just put, awesome, I like that bottle there.
**Jon Kluger:** And then it's like, hit a home run, don't drink Jack.
**Jon Kluger:** Like something as simple as that.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, then you can leverage the people that already drink Jack and just expose the awareness that, Holy, what's his name?
**Jon Kluger:** I can't even think of the guy.
**Jon Kluger:** Aaron Judge.
**Jon Kluger:** Holy.
**Jon Kluger:** Aaron Judge.
**Jon Kluger:** He has his own bourbon now.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, love Aaron Judge.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's go Yankees.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, boom.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, you can.
**Jon Kluger:** You can change that perception in that situation by informing.
**Jon Kluger:** So, like, that's where I view it as listing your competitor can be a good move.

**Ben Ijah:** I like that.
**Ben Ijah:** Now, with that, are we able to combine multiple topics or is that a V2 only?

**Jon Kluger:** That's going to be live on V2.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** But if you're doing an API call, why not Just do one for one topic, one for the other, and then find the overlap.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, that, that actually, yeah, that makes.

**Jon Kluger:** Sense because at the end of the day, the weighting of one versus the other might vary.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe they're medium for Jack Daniels, but they're low for the New York Yankees.
**Jon Kluger:** If you put them together, we always have the logic of we're going to tell you the lower of the two values before the higher because we don't want to give you a false promise and lead you in direction.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Of the poll we just did, as you can see, we were able to hit 31,255 in the last 24 hours.
**Jon Kluger:** Who like Bourbon and New York over the age of 24.
**Jon Kluger:** What we'll see here is low medium.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll see contact info, you see the location.
**Jon Kluger:** You can even see if they're married or they have children.
**Jon Kluger:** If we scroll over to the right, you'll get more of the business insights on the consumer level.
**Jon Kluger:** So we'll see their net worth, income range about the business that they work for, their LinkedIn URL and their potential job title.

**Ben Ijah:** Perfect.
**Ben Ijah:** So with that, as far as the like the intent score goes, are we able to use that as a filter criteria as well?

**Jon Kluger:** Yep, easy peasy.
**Jon Kluger:** That way.
**Jon Kluger:** Bourbon lovers New York.
**Jon Kluger:** This is just what I'm going to call this.
**Jon Kluger:** We do, by the way, just to be clear, if I didn't mention this already, location is based off of their home address, not their location.
**Jon Kluger:** In the moment of the poll, I just want to.
**Jon Kluger:** I had one guy who's like, how do you know where this person is?
**Jon Kluger:** I was like, I don't.
**Jon Kluger:** I just know what their legal address is.
**Jon Kluger:** Like.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, you'll easily be able to download as a CSV once the, the, the process is done.
**Jon Kluger:** What I will say is we have quite an extensive bit of data.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have, let's say 150,000 records, you're going to get close to 650 megabytes of data.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** What you can do in V2 is you can choose which columns that you want to export.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're doing an API call, just pull certain columns.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to pull certain columns, it's great.

**Ben Ijah:** That was my next question.
**Ben Ijah:** I swear.
**Ben Ijah:** The Audience Lab API, it doesn't make any sense in that.
**Ben Ijah:** All you're able to do is go ahead and basically create audiences and then see the status of audiences.
**Ben Ijah:** Like you can, you can't actually pull any like customer or lead data with the API.
**Ben Ijah:** It doesn't make any sense.

**Jon Kluger:** Here's an example result.

**Ben Ijah:** Perfect.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** I bring that up because I know you guys have it.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Here's another kicker that I like to tell people.
**Jon Kluger:** What's this?
**Jon Kluger:** You need help?

**Ben Ijah:** There you go.

**Jon Kluger:** We have the documentation written where it's code for it's.
**Jon Kluger:** It's in AI language.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not written by AI, but it's meant to be.
**Jon Kluger:** If you need to drop it in cloud code, tell it what you want it to build to connect to, and it will build it for you.
**Jon Kluger:** Because the data, the fields and all of the information is robust enough that it can put it together.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, makes sense.

**Jon Kluger:** Now, once we have this query, you can see in the upper right we have schedule.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can determine how often you want it to run, when it ends, the date, the active, or you can even offset dates.
**Jon Kluger:** I always say offset dates because that just means it will keep pushing it.
**Jon Kluger:** This is how you can set up the query to run in the back end.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say you create this query and every day you want it to run, you literally just set it to run every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** Hit save.
**Jon Kluger:** So we'll do it once, never hit save.
**Jon Kluger:** This is now scheduled to run every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** We do the same thing with an AD account.
**Jon Kluger:** Select the ad account, we're actually going to update it.
**Jon Kluger:** Not to be the webhook.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to be a lot cleaner than that.
**Jon Kluger:** In V2, we've had a couple people who didn't really understand how to do the webhook, so we wanted to make it ADA proof.
**Jon Kluger:** You can set how often you want it to repeat.
**Jon Kluger:** The really nice part about this is as you update that audience, it's going to push out those who no longer show intent because they won't be on this new updated list, you know, so.

**Ben Ijah:** Question for you then.
**Ben Ijah:** Right, because we're talking about webhook with the AD account, but not with the actual audience data.
**Ben Ijah:** Are we able to basically set it up so that each time it refreshes, the actual, like, audience data automatically updates and gets pressed to a.
**Ben Ijah:** Or passed to a webhook as well.
**Ben Ijah:** Or I guess that'd be the same.
**Ben Ijah:** Right, because it'd be the same exact data that's going correct.
**Ben Ijah:** Is it?
**Ben Ijah:** Or because I guess the information that's going to the AD data would just be.
**Ben Ijah:** It's not their IP address.
**Ben Ijah:** I forget exactly what it is.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** So we're just passing that to the AD account, right?
**Ben Ijah:** No, it's passing everything.

**Jon Kluger:** I have to double check if we're passing everything, but typically we do.
**Jon Kluger:** I We, we have this identifier, which is typically what meta he cares about.
**Jon Kluger:** If we don't have this, we still pass over Charles Del here, but we just pass over his first name, his last name, his personal email, his other things so that ideally meta can identify him if we haven't already.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay, so, but it's primarily just going to be contact info that's getting okay.
**Ben Ijah:** So.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, I mean, that would be my question then is are we able to.
**Ben Ijah:** And it's not a big deal, right?
**Ben Ijah:** Like, it's just running a regularly scheduled.
**Ben Ijah:** Regularly scheduled API call or if there's the web hook, that means that we can just automatically trigger it based off of that.

**Jon Kluger:** Do me a favor, after this call, email me that question and I'll just pass it over because I want to make sure I have your exact language right for your exact use case.

**Ben Ijah:** Because the tech.

**Jon Kluger:** I always, I always say this is his exact words.
**Jon Kluger:** If there are confusion, I will ask, but don't act like I know what he's.
**Jon Kluger:** He's asking sometimes.
**Jon Kluger:** So I'll double check with that.
**Jon Kluger:** I just know we're moving away from the webhook URL because it's caused some confusion.
**Jon Kluger:** And if people are.
**Jon Kluger:** You can actually manage multiple metas through a single license.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you're doing that, the webhooks can literally have issues with manual error.
**Jon Kluger:** Like someone can literally just put in the wrong one and next thing we know there's chaos or you blowing a whole ad budget.

**Ben Ijah:** Gotcha.
**Ben Ijah:** Okay, cool.
**Ben Ijah:** I went ahead and wrote it down, so I got it for you.

**Jon Kluger:** Beautiful.
**Jon Kluger:** So in terms of the saved queries, Bourbon Lubber, New York.
**Jon Kluger:** Next run is going to be.
**Jon Kluger:** It was saved at 6:40, next run will be at 6:43.
**Jon Kluger:** So it essentially will set the time.
**Jon Kluger:** If we want to go and edit it, we can always schedule it to read.
**Jon Kluger:** What I recommend is if you want to do it early, you.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm going to see if.
**Jon Kluger:** You know what, why don't we have that.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm going to ask them if we can edit with time the queries run.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason we have it spread out is because our fear is if everyone sets theirs at, you know, 12:01am Then the system will get hundreds of thousands of calls and it might freak out.

**Ben Ijah:** 3,000 per second limit, right?

**Jon Kluger:** You got it.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay, so.
**Ben Ijah:** And it's.
**Ben Ijah:** It's actually not a big deal.
**Ben Ijah:** So if there, if that time that it's going to be refreshed is listed and it's listed in the API, then it doesn't matter.
**Ben Ijah:** I can just go ahead and basically set it to just automatically pull it each day at that time.
**Ben Ijah:** And we don't have to necessarily worry about the web hook triggering it.

**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Ben Ijah:** Cool.

**Jon Kluger:** Now that is essentially us in a high level overview.

**Ben Ijah:** The new.

**Jon Kluger:** The new V2, like I said, it's going to allow for free form.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to be a lot sexier.
**Jon Kluger:** Hold on, I've got somewhere.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, I don't want you to read all the messages.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me see if I have any notes.

**Ben Ijah:** So I guess my next question then would be on visitor identification.
**Ben Ijah:** I don't want to get you off track if you're.

**Jon Kluger:** No, no, no.
**Jon Kluger:** I was just trying to see.
**Jon Kluger:** Someone sent me one of our.
**Jon Kluger:** One of the other execs sent over what was anticipated.
**Jon Kluger:** Some of the features in v2, but we communicate in way too many channels.
**Jon Kluger:** Will be on text, we'll be on WhatsApp being Slack.
**Jon Kluger:** So I was just seeing if I could see it in WhatsApp.
**Jon Kluger:** But it's probably on my phone and I'm not picking out my phone because then I get distracted by the text messages.
**Jon Kluger:** So that being said, going back to the website identifier.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** So with that, I guess you are, because I was going to say, are you basically able to route it to a specific campaign?
**Ben Ijah:** And I guess you probably could, right?
**Ben Ijah:** Because you're just using the IP address for that.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.
**Ben Ijah:** Okay, cool.
**Ben Ijah:** And then so, yeah, that actually answers all that I was going to ask, like if they're not already part of a campaign based off of that intent, they probably now be added to a campaign because.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, cool.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** And this also just helps.
**Jon Kluger:** What I always say is if in your CRM you pulled this intent data and you've made efforts to create marketing and these people are being shown ads because they're part of the audience that you choose, I would automatically have them push to your CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** And then if they land as a visitor, then you can create a trigger internally that is a checkbox, a yes or a no, whatever you want.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe it's a counter of how many times they've come to the website since then.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, so you can actually keep this on the recurring.
**Jon Kluger:** Because like if Stephen comes in today, Stephen comes in today, we can actually create the ruling when it was created at.
**Jon Kluger:** So we, we don't, we don't store all of this beyond I have to check our certain date.
**Jon Kluger:** But like if you have someone that comes in and they're created in here, it triggers an API call.
**Jon Kluger:** The API call goes to your CRM and tries to match it.
**Jon Kluger:** If it positively matches it, it adds talent to how many times they've been to the website.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
**Ben Ijah:** We've got like something similar set up with that in terms of, like, tracking our email opens and click.
**Ben Ijah:** So that's.
**Ben Ijah:** That's great.
**Ben Ijah:** And then we could also tie it back.
**Ben Ijah:** So if they don't click on the ad or they don't click on the email, we can tie it back to say, hey, they didn't click on the email, but they actually did get to the site.
**Ben Ijah:** So that's.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** And maybe you say a threshold of five clicks without a Contact Us, five visits without a Contact Us, then that triggers a.
**Jon Kluger:** Add them to a direct mail campaign.
**Jon Kluger:** Could easily do that as well.

**Ben Ijah:** That's great.
**Ben Ijah:** Okay.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, I mean, that's.
**Ben Ijah:** That's great.
**Ben Ijah:** This makes perfect sense.
**Ben Ijah:** I'll be completely honest and frank with you.
**Ben Ijah:** This, what you're doing, it kind of like light years ahead of Audience Lab.
**Ben Ijah:** Your API actually makes sense.
**Ben Ijah:** Like I said at first, they were trying to say that they're going to basically have to charge us again for creating a tie in that lets us actually pull data from the API.
**Ben Ijah:** And I'm like, why do people even use the API if you can't get actual audience data from it?
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, this is great.

**Jon Kluger:** They want to nickel and dime you at the end of the day.
**Jon Kluger:** There's a reason that the CEO of Audience Lab is blocked on all of our socials, and it's because he would go into the comments of our posts and our ads and make false statements.
**Jon Kluger:** He literally was like.
**Jon Kluger:** He literally says to us, your data is crap.
**Jon Kluger:** They're renting it from us and they charge you by record.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's look at those three statements.
**Jon Kluger:** If we're buying your data charging less and our data is crap.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, it's.
**Ben Ijah:** If it's crap, it's their data.

**Jon Kluger:** So why would you ever make those public state comments like he's.
**Jon Kluger:** It's the whole thing.
**Jon Kluger:** We.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not supposed to say not so nice things about him because we're trying to be professional, but, like, sometimes.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not Italian.
**Jon Kluger:** But the only thing I can say is.
**Jon Kluger:** How we break this down.
**Jon Kluger:** This is our current offer that we have available for you.
**Jon Kluger:** It would be this because you need the API.
**Jon Kluger:** This is our current offer that we have available until February 6th.
**Jon Kluger:** Prices will go up then because of the pre V2.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, I'm gonna open the door because my dog is acting weird.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, go ahead.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry.
**Jon Kluger:** She's looking Back at me every 30 seconds.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, come on, on what we can do.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to do white label, where you have the individualized instances, we can set that up.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to do a single license with the API access, get a feeling of where you're at and then in a month or two say, hey Jonathan, I want to upgrade, let's do the white label.
**Jon Kluger:** We can do that.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** What I, what I, what I want to highlight is for the white label you get 5 pixels for each license, and then after your 10th license, every additional license is just 100 bucks.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I mean by that, say you need another 20.
**Jon Kluger:** Now your average cost of a license is less than a single license.

**Ben Ijah:** So.
**Ben Ijah:** And when you're talking about licensing, you're basically talking about white, white labeling the platform.
**Ben Ijah:** Right?
**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** And then each instance would be an individualized instance for the API called to call to, so that the data stays kind of in a singular loop and there's no possibility of wires being crossed or chaos ensuing.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Now we have clients that will literally turn around, present this to their clients, and the clients are just mind blown on the intent.
**Jon Kluger:** Data that can be pulled and when V2 comes out, it'll be very sexy, it'll be very nice.
**Jon Kluger:** What you can even do is you can let them have access to it as a playground.
**Jon Kluger:** Just tell them, don't hit, don't hit send to ad account, don't hit this or don't hit that or whatever.
**Jon Kluger:** You need to tell them if we need to put up guardrails with a sub account, you let us know.
**Jon Kluger:** We can probably put that together for you, no problem.
**Jon Kluger:** Where they can just build audiences and then not and download them, but not actually push them places.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's something that we can work out.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that is because this allows for you to brand it to your company.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, you can charge whatever the hell you want because when they see retarget IQ in the upper left, they're going to go, well, he has one account for all of his clients and he's only paying eleven hundred dollars.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't want to pay him X, Y and Z. Yeah, I know.
**Jon Kluger:** I have clients that literally have white label.
**Jon Kluger:** They pay for all 10 licenses and they're working their way towards getting to a 10 license count because they're selling the full scale service for two grand a month to people.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
**Ben Ijah:** Okay, you know, I've got another question for you then, John.
**Ben Ijah:** As far as like pricing and like volume and Stuff like that goes.
**Ben Ijah:** Do you guys provide any kind of guarantees around?
**Ben Ijah:** Like, you know, we're, we're providing like unlimited access to data right now.
**Ben Ijah:** We guarantee that we're not going to pull that away for X amount of time.

**Jon Kluger:** Ben, if you come to me and you say I need 50 of these licenses, we're going to put a contract together regardless.
**Jon Kluger:** Because that's quite a financial commitment.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, if you come to me and say I need 20, any sort of volume, we will.
**Jon Kluger:** For, for our white labels, we have a contract.
**Jon Kluger:** We say that in the contract.
**Jon Kluger:** And if you need it stipulated in the contract again or in any way, shape or form, we've got some good lawyers.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm sure you do too.
**Jon Kluger:** They can put in, they can do the lawyer talk and then we can make sure everybody's happy.
**Jon Kluger:** Because for white labels, we do docusign agreements.
**Jon Kluger:** We do all of that sort of stuff.
**Jon Kluger:** We ask for if you, if you're able to do annual, like, that would be incredible.
**Jon Kluger:** I know that's a financial commitment, but like, as you can see, just switching from monthly to annual, you're saving a grand a month.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you switched over.
**Jon Kluger:** You want to do annual, you want 40 accounts, whatever it is, seven times 12, we're at 70, we're at $82,000 a year.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say we gladly tell you you're good, you're locked in.

**Ben Ijah:** Cool.
**Ben Ijah:** Cool.
**Ben Ijah:** So then, yeah, I mean, let's, let's do this.
**Ben Ijah:** Like I said, I've actually got someone who I've already got ready to pay for, for audience lab.
**Ben Ijah:** Let me, I'm going to go ahead and hop on the line with him and then this is, this is.
**Ben Ijah:** Honestly, this conversation couldn't have been better.
**Ben Ijah:** Time.

**Jon Kluger:** Love it.

**Ben Ijah:** So, yeah, go ahead and.
**Ben Ijah:** Go ahead.

**Jon Kluger:** The ads work.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** Oh, definitely.
**Ben Ijah:** Definitely.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** And that's, that's a great call out.
**Ben Ijah:** Like basically advertising on a competitor.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, it's great.
**Ben Ijah:** Okay.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** So let me go ahead and talk with him.
**Ben Ijah:** We might need to go ahead and like hop through this demo one more time.

**Jon Kluger:** You get the recording too, remember?
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to show him clips of that or anything like that.

**Ben Ijah:** Cool.

**Jon Kluger:** If you need to hop on, never let me know, we can jump on.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm cool.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm easy.
**Jon Kluger:** I work the weekends.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not going to make you, but I work the weekend, so I'm around.
**Jon Kluger:** Just let me know what you're gravitating towards.
**Jon Kluger:** Is it right to say you're thinking more white label right now or Are you just thinking single license?
**Jon Kluger:** Just so I can keep record?

**Ben Ijah:** I'm thinking more so single license, but doing at least like a quarterly, maybe annual, but yeah, definitely more towards a single license right now.
**Ben Ijah:** And then I want to basically kind of go ahead, I told you, I've got a couple clients that I want to kind of go ahead and you know, make sure the data is working on a, on a advertising standpoint.
**Ben Ijah:** And from there I mean I would, I would love to be able to go ahead and get some, some white labeling relationships.
**Ben Ijah:** I'm just the kind of guy, I want to make sure that I've got.

**Jon Kluger:** You know, before I'm doing it.
**Jon Kluger:** What I think we can do what I recommend for people in your exact circumstance.
**Jon Kluger:** Just lock you in at a quarter that gets you in at the 749 for the single license in forever.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** You then need to upgrade to white label and you're feeling good.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll honor these prices that are part of the pre upgrade.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** And then we can move over to white label and do it however it makes sense for you.
**Jon Kluger:** So I always tell my partners, try one with one client.
**Jon Kluger:** You're going to be so happy.
**Jon Kluger:** You're not even gonna question the possibility of, of of the situation in terms of paying for, for it.
**Jon Kluger:** It's super duper easy.
**Jon Kluger:** If you decide you want to move forward, we'll send over a strike link for the quarterly.
**Jon Kluger:** You can throw a credit card, you can clarify it, you can do whatever.
**Jon Kluger:** And then if you get a month in and you go, holy shit, this is incredible.
**Jon Kluger:** Jonathan, let's do white label.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's roll it out to everyone.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll prorate the remainder of your quarterly plan for the single license to the cost of the initial month, quarter, whatever it might be for the white label upgrade.
**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm easy man.
**Jon Kluger:** Like I told you is at the end of the day, finding good partnerships is what helps businesses grow.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not being an and nickel and dining people and then trying to get in the way of you doing your job.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, yeah, exactly.
**Ben Ijah:** Cool.
**Ben Ijah:** Well thanks again, John.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, and shouts out to your, your grandfather too, man, he's, he definitely created a monster.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm sure he appreciates that.

**Ben Ijah:** Cool.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** Like I said, let me go ahead and I'm going to speak to one of my clients because they're ready to go with already.
**Ben Ijah:** So this is, this is going to.

**Jon Kluger:** Be a no brainer once you pay.
**Jon Kluger:** If you decide you want to move forward on the single license, I can send over the strike link via email.
**Jon Kluger:** Beforehand.
**Jon Kluger:** Or we can just wait.
**Jon Kluger:** You can email me.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm John at the target iq.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm super easy in terms of getting a hold of.
**Jon Kluger:** Then from there, once you pay, I should get a Slack alert.
**Jon Kluger:** If I don't, for some reason, I always recommend just email me, say hey.
**Jon Kluger:** And then from there, what I'll be able to do is actually CC Sydney, who's our account support specialist.
**Jon Kluger:** She'll set up your credentials, we'll set you up on a dedicated Slack channel, and you'll be good to go.
**Jon Kluger:** The best thing is if you ever have a problem, loom yourself, loom a video, take a screenshot, send it through the Slack, and we'll be there to support.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't believe in having you to have to pay a ton of extra money just to be able to have a direct line of communication.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, okay, perfect.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** I would say this.
**Ben Ijah:** Go ahead and shoot that link over the payment link because like I said, we're.
**Ben Ijah:** We're about ready to go.
**Ben Ijah:** I do have one other question for you.
**Ben Ijah:** I did bring up the fact that this client wanted to kind of vet some of the data.
**Ben Ijah:** Are you guys cool with shooting over like a sample list of like 10 folks or something?

**Jon Kluger:** I can't, unfortunately, send any samples because our data provider will kill us.
**Jon Kluger:** That's literally part of our agreement.
**Jon Kluger:** Direct agreement with DOM is we can't give away data.
**Jon Kluger:** We can't prevent our clients from doing so, but we physically can't do that because they view it as a, like, threat to their business.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay, understood.
**Ben Ijah:** Understood.
**Ben Ijah:** Well, yeah, go ahead and shoot that link over.
**Ben Ijah:** I'll let you know if I have any other questions.
**Ben Ijah:** As far as the webhook question goes, I think I'm good on that because if we're able to see when the list is actually gonna get refreshed and that's.
**Ben Ijah:** We can just set it to pull then.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, so cool.
**Ben Ijah:** Shoot that over and then like I said, I'll speak to my team and.

**Jon Kluger:** Sounds good.
**Jon Kluger:** Where are you based out of?

**Ben Ijah:** San Diego.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm.
**Jon Kluger:** It's on my list of places I actually need to visit because I hear incredible things about it.
**Jon Kluger:** Everyone says you might not love certain parts California, but I've never heard someone complain about San Diego.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, it's funny.
**Ben Ijah:** It's funny, right?
**Ben Ijah:** Because I. I've lived all over Southern California, LA, Orange County, San Diego, and I always.
**Ben Ijah:** I explain the three counties like this, right?
**Ben Ijah:** So LA is the furthest north.
**Ben Ijah:** Orange County's in the middle.
**Ben Ijah:** San Diego is like the lower part.

**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**Ben Ijah:** So LA's got the most amount of stuff to do.
**Ben Ijah:** Hideous people.
**Ben Ijah:** Orange County's got kind of like the mid amount of stuff to do.
**Ben Ijah:** And the middle, like the mid type of person.

**Jon Kluger:** Person.

**Ben Ijah:** San Diego, in terms of like the other two counties, has got the least amount of stuff to do.
**Ben Ijah:** But the best people.

**Jon Kluger:** I like that.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Well, if I come out, you play golf at all?

**Ben Ijah:** Oh, man, all the time.
**Ben Ijah:** I love golf.
**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm not ironically at my la.
**Jon Kluger:** My LA Country Club shirt on, but I. I'm a big golfer.
**Jon Kluger:** Can you.
**Jon Kluger:** Can you, can you.
**Jon Kluger:** Can we play golf and you give me the resident Tory Pines rate, please?

**Ben Ijah:** You know, yeah, let's do it.
**Ben Ijah:** Interesting, because I think you have to actually live in Torrey Pines or, like, know someone in there.
**Ben Ijah:** But I should be able to make something happen.
**Ben Ijah:** I can pull a couple strings.

**Jon Kluger:** One of my friends love, he lives out there and he loves to send me a video of him on Tory Pines being like only $75.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm just like, you're an for rubbing that in my face.

**Ben Ijah:** So he lives in the city of Tory Ponds, right?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm jealous of him.
**Jon Kluger:** He tells me that all the time and I'm like, bro, you're like a 40 handicap.
**Jon Kluger:** You need to stay off of that office.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, you're literally the reason that people go out there and they go, what?
**Jon Kluger:** Left six divots in a row and it's like, Pleasure.
**Jon Kluger:** Keep an eye out.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll have that email over to you.
**Jon Kluger:** The payment link is split.
**Jon Kluger:** So one is the payment for the license, one is for the API.
**Jon Kluger:** We just do that so we have it on record.
**Jon Kluger:** If you tell me I don't want an API anymore, I can turn that off without having you make a whole new payment and do all of that nonsense.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you see it, just be aware there'll be two.
**Jon Kluger:** Once you knock out both, you're good to go.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, sounds good.
**Ben Ijah:** Sounds good.
**Ben Ijah:** Cool, cool.
**Ben Ijah:** And then, you know, I will say this, though, in terms of, like, the whole not being able to provide, like a sample list.
**Ben Ijah:** I think because of that, the client might want to do like a month to month to start, but either way, we should be good to go.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** If we do a month to month to start, I'll.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll see what I can do to negotiate you guys down a little bit just to be able to give you that first month before you scale up.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** So we can always rock and roll from there.
**Jon Kluger:** Like if there's a specific search that you need that you're looking at, and you want to know the number of records.
**Jon Kluger:** And maybe I can have two or three in the top slip through.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, just let me know.

**Ben Ijah:** So let's do this, then, as far as that goes.
**Ben Ijah:** So this is going to be a client who is a bathroom remodeling contractor.
**Ben Ijah:** And we'd want to go ahead and kind of focus on.
**Ben Ijah:** Let's see how.
**Ben Ijah:** How it would pop up.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** Bathroom modeling.
**Ben Ijah:** And that's going to be.
**Ben Ijah:** That's funny.
**Ben Ijah:** So you got both searches.
**Ben Ijah:** So it'll be in.
**Ben Ijah:** Let's go ahead and say Murietta and Temecula.
**Ben Ijah:** If we've got to do counties, we can do Riverside County.

**Jon Kluger:** So we want to do zip.
**Jon Kluger:** How we address zip, okay, is we'll go in here and one of the counties or the cities.

**Ben Ijah:** Let's go ahead and say Murietta.
**Ben Ijah:** M U R R I E T.

**Jon Kluger:** A U R R I U D.

**Ben Ijah:** No, I E T A I E T N. Temecula.
**Ben Ijah:** Let's say Corona.

**Jon Kluger:** Corona.

**Ben Ijah:** And then I think that'll be fine for now.
**Ben Ijah:** Let's.
**Ben Ijah:** Let's focus on those.

**Jon Kluger:** Please provide me all zip codes from Marietta, Temecula, Corona, California.

**Ben Ijah:** Yes.

**Jon Kluger:** Zip codes in California.
**Jon Kluger:** California cities of Marietta, Temecula, Corona.
**Jon Kluger:** And they're metropolitan areas, or you just want the towns.

**Ben Ijah:** So those are basically just like smaller California cities.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm out of Raleigh currently.

**Ben Ijah:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** But I travel a whole bunch.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm trying to always be on the move because I find it fun to see new places and do new things.
**Jon Kluger:** So we'll see.
**Jon Kluger:** Last year, I went to five new countries.
**Jon Kluger:** This year, I'm hoping to exceed that.
**Jon Kluger:** If you've never been to Rio de Janeiro, that's probably at the top of the.
**Jon Kluger:** My list in terms of trips I've ever been in my entire life.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, the cost was great, the people were great.
**Jon Kluger:** The best piece of advice I had, a good friend of mine lives in the region.
**Jon Kluger:** He grew up there.
**Jon Kluger:** She literally said, if a road goes like this, don't go up it.
**Jon Kluger:** And he goes, if there's a girl way out of your league and you meet her at a club and her English comes off at, come with me.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's go somewhere else.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, don't go with her.
**Jon Kluger:** He goes, two rules and you'll be fine.
**Jon Kluger:** He goes, don't think because you're an American, a beautiful Brazilian woman is suddenly going to want you, she might rob you.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was like, oh.
**Jon Kluger:** And he's like, you're not that hot, buddy.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm like, fair.
**Jon Kluger:** So when we do zip, instead of saying equal, we'll say in.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll upload the file.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** That's awesome.
**Ben Ijah:** Brazil's on my bucket list.
**Ben Ijah:** I've been all over Europe, been all over, like, the Caribbean.
**Ben Ijah:** Haven't made it out to.
**Ben Ijah:** I mean, I've been a few places in South America, but I haven't been all over out there yet.

**Jon Kluger:** It's beautiful.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm trying to go to Argentina next because I hear spectacular things about it and I wouldn't mind hiking in the Andes mountains.
**Jon Kluger:** That sounds sick to me, but I went to.
**Jon Kluger:** Have you been to Portugal?

**Ben Ijah:** No.
**Ben Ijah:** So I was.
**Ben Ijah:** I was this close to going there.
**Ben Ijah:** I've been to Spain.

**Jon Kluger:** I've never been to a city.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, I don't know if you eat pork.
**Jon Kluger:** I know some people don't.
**Jon Kluger:** But, like, Iberico ham is a game changer.

**Ben Ijah:** It's literally about the.
**Ben Ijah:** Like, the lunch meat, right?
**Ben Ijah:** Not lunch meat, but, like, how they slice it off and everything for you, right?

**Jon Kluger:** It's even better.
**Jon Kluger:** So an Iberico ham is a type of pig that only eats acorn and herbs raised in the Iberic region.
**Jon Kluger:** Its meat is so clean, you can cook it to a medium rare point, like a steak.
**Jon Kluger:** It doesn't look like pork.
**Jon Kluger:** It's red, it's not pink.
**Jon Kluger:** It eats better than any steak I've ever had in my life.
**Jon Kluger:** It is game changing.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, the food scene in Lisbon is incredible because you don't open a restaurant unless you want to cook for your neighborhood friends.
**Jon Kluger:** I went to four separate Michelin star restaurants of the course the week.
**Jon Kluger:** Didn't spend more than 60 bucks at any of them, and had two drinks.

**Ben Ijah:** Wow, okay.
**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, you sold it then.
**Ben Ijah:** I've got a good friend of mine.
**Ben Ijah:** You're talking about lawyers, a Harvard lawyer.
**Ben Ijah:** And he actually went and he and his wife moved to Portugal for a while because I think it's.
**Ben Ijah:** You live there for like a year or two, you get like automatic citizenship.

**Jon Kluger:** That's what one of my buddies is doing.
**Jon Kluger:** He has the nomad visa there, and now his daughter's about to be born there.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm like, you know, this is a problem.
**Jon Kluger:** He's like, why?
**Jon Kluger:** And I was like, she's going to speak Portuguese and you're not, because you still haven't even learned it yet.
**Jon Kluger:** So don't be one of those people that has to have their daughter come to the door who's four years old to translate for you.
**Jon Kluger:** And he's like, no, no, no, we're not going to do that.
**Jon Kluger:** So in terms of this SQL query for the last 24 hours, the people that are searching for bathroom remodeling in these zip codes look like this.

**Ben Ijah:** That is perfect.
**Ben Ijah:** Okay.
**Ben Ijah:** And then so we got a mix of medium, low and then.
**Ben Ijah:** So like remind me what it, what, what it takes to be a high again.

**Jon Kluger:** It's just consistent behavior over extended period of time.
**Jon Kluger:** So you're a high right now of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** That means in the last 24 hours, your behavior leading up to that point has consistently shown behavior.
**Jon Kluger:** It's, it's not like you suddenly jump onto the intent radar as nothing high.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll scale up essentially.
**Jon Kluger:** Or maybe you start at low and then you just do a shit ton of research one day where you get jumped up to high.
**Jon Kluger:** But at some point there, you're going to rise up because it's, it's, it's not like, hey, we today we decided to look at all of it for the past period.
**Jon Kluger:** It's no that we know this person's already been doing this.
**Jon Kluger:** They're continuing to do this.
**Jon Kluger:** Now we're going to upgrade them essentially.

**Ben Ijah:** Gotcha.
**Ben Ijah:** So I just thought about something and take it or leave it.
**Ben Ijah:** But this would be an interesting signal specifically for like consumables.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** So when we're talking about things like the alcohol brands, right.
**Ben Ijah:** So you said that someone basically a buying signal is someone no longer searching for it.
**Ben Ijah:** Right?
**Ben Ijah:** They search, then they stop searching.
**Ben Ijah:** That could be an interesting like audience specifically for people that are trying to sell consumables.
**Ben Ijah:** Because just, because they, we know that they've probably purchased within a certain amount of time and they're probably going to need to re up on that.

**Jon Kluger:** And so that is.
**Jon Kluger:** Yes, I, I agree and I 100 think that would be valuable.
**Jon Kluger:** The issue we have is the amount of data that we'd have to store on the long term to be able to do that.
**Jon Kluger:** That's the only challenge.
**Jon Kluger:** That's why essentially is if you were, let's say for a specific client, you maintain the record of everyone who's ever shown intent, low, medium, high, and you say when their intent fell off, then you can maintain the record of that contact.
**Jon Kluger:** When they come back around, they all of a sudden have their intent raised again.
**Jon Kluger:** You can view them as has this person had intent before?
**Jon Kluger:** Like, how long was it since the last time that they.
**Jon Kluger:** This value was true?
**Jon Kluger:** And you can keep track of it internally.
**Jon Kluger:** We just have 50,010 topics.
**Jon Kluger:** So keeping track of all of that.
**Jon Kluger:** My tech guy would kill me.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean I'm sure your, your like cloud storage costs are astronomical as well already.
**Ben Ijah:** Okay, yeah, that makes perfect sense and that's really cool.
**Ben Ijah:** So I guess in order to do that, we basically want to have the event window as large as possible to kind of track it across the entire horizon.
**Ben Ijah:** Right.
**Ben Ijah:** And then if they fall off.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, yeah, that's we say do two weeks and then if someone, you look at the two week phrase and then every day you update a two week span.
**Jon Kluger:** That way you can see as people fall off and as new people come in.
**Jon Kluger:** Because it could be someone fell off 16 days ago and then all of a sudden tomorrow they're back on.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's like if we looked at it too wide, you would never get an indication of the behavior change in the middle.

**Ben Ijah:** Yeah.
**Ben Ijah:** Okay, so.
**Ben Ijah:** And I've got a few other questions for you.
**Ben Ijah:** In terms of.
**Ben Ijah:** So you guys do demographic data as well.
**Ben Ijah:** Like so you're able to go ahead and pull through that stuff.
**Ben Ijah:** Now in terms of data, are you guys exclusively us?
**Ben Ijah:** Are you guys global?

**Jon Kluger:** So we will be global in V2.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, well V2, Europe will phase.
**Jon Kluger:** Will have.
**Jon Kluger:** In phases because of all of their compliancy nonsense.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll have South America, Latin America, Canada, all of that by February 14th, 15th and then Europe will.
**Jon Kluger:** That might be a little bit of a slower, kind of gradual process just because of all of the data adherence and data requirements.
**Jon Kluger:** Like we definitely won't be doing pixels probably in Europe just because they are sticklers on that stuff.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing that I will tell you, by the way, I'm going to kick this thing out because this is secret info.
