## Transcript

**Jon Kluger:** To do to kick things off is just get a little bit of an understanding of your business and why you joined this call today.
**Jon Kluger:** So I can kind of cater our demo accordingly.

**Matthew Kerner:** Yeah, no, totally.
**Matthew Kerner:** And I totally forgot to bring a charger to my computer.
**Matthew Kerner:** My computer may die.
**Matthew Kerner:** I might have to join back on the phone.
**Matthew Kerner:** But yeah, long story short, I mean, I'm marketing company.
**Matthew Kerner:** I've been using Audience Lab.
**Matthew Kerner:** You guys use a targeted ad that said, hey, if you use Audience Lab, save some money.
**Matthew Kerner:** So.
**Matthew Kerner:** And I'm just curious as to not just the cost, but really what is.
**Matthew Kerner:** Is there a difference in terms of the quality of reports or records that are obtained, how that happens and then, yeah, a little bit about the plan.
**Matthew Kerner:** So familiarity with Audience Lab and kind.

**Jon Kluger:** Of go from there for my knowledge.
**Jon Kluger:** So I can do kind of a direct comparison.
**Jon Kluger:** Which plan are you on currently for Audience Lab?

**Matthew Kerner:** At the moment I'm on the.
**Matthew Kerner:** Oh, sorry, I'm at Starbucks right now.
**Matthew Kerner:** I'm on.
**Matthew Kerner:** On the light.
**Matthew Kerner:** But I'm getting ready to scale with a personal injury firm, so probably scale it up.
**Matthew Kerner:** But yeah, so I mean, it's like I'm only paying 4.97amonth right now.
**Matthew Kerner:** But it's.
**Matthew Kerner:** It's a limited plan and I'm looking to scale like I said.
**Matthew Kerner:** So just kind of intrigued about what are the options that you guys have?

**Jon Kluger:** And perfect, I can dive in right away.
**Jon Kluger:** I only ask because we do have a white label option.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't think you need it.
**Jon Kluger:** From the sounds of it, if you only have you plus one additional client, once you start getting a 5, 6, 7, 8 clients, then we can start talking to white labeling.
**Jon Kluger:** So for now that our equivalent at 497 price wise is going to give you a whole lot more.
**Jon Kluger:** So right off the bat, I can tell you we have no cap on the number of audiences and we have no cap on the number of records.

**Matthew Kerner:** Right off the bat.

**Jon Kluger:** So you're getting a lot more capacity and a lot more ability.
**Jon Kluger:** Additionally, we actually use a more quality data source than Audience Lab and a wider array of data sources.
**Jon Kluger:** So the data source that we use, we have an exclusivity contract that less than the number of people I can hold up on one hand in the world have access to.
**Jon Kluger:** This is from a data provider that provides all Fortune 100 companies their intent data.
**Jon Kluger:** I can't disclose it by name, unfortunately, but what I can tell you is the starting price to even access it is at least $250,000 a month.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, that is Our starting kind of core data set.
**Jon Kluger:** From there we have an additional 200 data sets, our data lakes, that waterfall enrich that data and fill in any of the gaps that might be there.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, we literally got off a call with an audience, a former audience lab user today.
**Jon Kluger:** And they've seen their costs of per lead have.
**Jon Kluger:** While their conversions have 3x just right off the bat.

**Matthew Kerner:** So let me.
**Matthew Kerner:** Yeah, so let me, let me clarify a couple of things.
**Matthew Kerner:** Just make sure that talking the same stuff.
**Matthew Kerner:** So when you say unlimited audiences.

**Jon Kluger:** I.

**Matthew Kerner:** Mean so for audience Lab that means like I could have a window company and then a PI company and then I could have one that's targeted just for auto accident, but then one is for med.
**Matthew Kerner:** Now like each one of those is a separate audience.
**Matthew Kerner:** So in the, in the audience lab world, as opposed to an audience, let's say is you know, windows and doors.
**Matthew Kerner:** And then from that I can segment out that one audience into different segments.
**Matthew Kerner:** You know, one that's geared more towards phone calls, one that's geared more towards.

**Jon Kluger:** Email or it's a little more simple.
**Jon Kluger:** So any sort of intent list you would build, let's say for a window cleaning service, let's say that is just what that's.
**Jon Kluger:** You can create as many of those as you want in terms of connecting directly into their go high level or pushing it to them, or running it for them.
**Jon Kluger:** That is an individual instance.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to just create 10,000 audiences, which is just the query of intent data plus specific filters, you can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to make a million records in each of those, you can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to then connect into multiple go high levels, that's when there's a little bit of an additional fee per additional connector.
**Jon Kluger:** But beyond that, you can connect to as many meta accounts as you'd like and you can download as many leads as you'd like.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can always access them as a CSV.
**Jon Kluger:** You can have them refresh whenever you'd like.
**Jon Kluger:** Essentially, we don't look at it as putting a cap on you in terms of data discovery.
**Jon Kluger:** The only thing that we look at is if you wanted to have an instance that your client would log in and use and they could also pull data and they could also interact with it.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a separate license.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Matthew Kerner:** That's probably more the white label license that you're talking about kind of going in that direction.
**Matthew Kerner:** But if I'm using the data and I'm pulling in, let's say it's my high level But I've got different sub accounts.
**Matthew Kerner:** How does that work?

**Jon Kluger:** You're good.
**Jon Kluger:** Like you can literally do as much as you want and you just push.

**Matthew Kerner:** It over to go high level.
**Matthew Kerner:** Okay.
**Matthew Kerner:** And so when we're talking about intent data as well.
**Matthew Kerner:** So is it keywords, is it intent search?
**Matthew Kerner:** Like, how are you?
**Matthew Kerner:** How am I creating an audience?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we'll walk through that here real quick.
**Jon Kluger:** What it is.
**Jon Kluger:** We have about 43,000 intent topics currently.
**Jon Kluger:** In two weeks, when we roll out V2, you'll actually be able to put direct terms, direct search terms into the intent category yourself.
**Jon Kluger:** So right now I was talking to someone earlier who was looking for auto accident lawyer.
**Jon Kluger:** People that are looking for lawyers for an auto accident.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now we don't have auto accident lawyer, we have auto accident.
**Jon Kluger:** But come two weeks from now, you'll be able to search that exact phrase.
**Jon Kluger:** And if it's something you need in the intro, you let us know and we can reach out to our internal teams to see if they can add that intent topic for you as well.

**Matthew Kerner:** Okay.
**Matthew Kerner:** Yeah.
**Matthew Kerner:** The two main intent topics that I'd be looking at in the beginning would be employment law for California and then workers comp in Florida.
**Matthew Kerner:** I know the states don't matter, but I'm just, just talking out loud.
**Matthew Kerner:** Yeah.
**Matthew Kerner:** So you know someone who's reaching out to the Department of Labor because they've been wrongfully terminated or they didn't get paid their overtime or that type of.

**Jon Kluger:** Stuffed up employment law.

**Matthew Kerner:** That'd be the like one of the main lists that I'm looking for.

**Jon Kluger:** So I'll show you that one real quick.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're looking at intent.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see in our audience builder here is you have advanced search.
**Jon Kluger:** Think of that as no intent Data.
**Jon Kluger:** It's a LinkedIn search almost kind of vibe.
**Jon Kluger:** Like you, you set your parameters, you select the variables and then you just hit go.
**Jon Kluger:** It looks at nothing to do with intent.
**Jon Kluger:** That's advanced search.
**Jon Kluger:** B2C focuses on consumer based intent and B2B is business related intent.
**Jon Kluger:** So here I would look at.
**Jon Kluger:** There we go.
**Jon Kluger:** Employment law.
**Jon Kluger:** You look at the last two weeks, add a rule you said for California.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, in California.
**Jon Kluger:** And then we hit build.
**Jon Kluger:** It says 15 to 20 minutes.
**Jon Kluger:** That's not the case.
**Jon Kluger:** It's really just the amount of time it takes you to check your phone, look at your email, send a response, just hit refresh and you'll get your results.
**Jon Kluger:** What you then can see here on the left side is the personal information.
**Jon Kluger:** On the right side is Gravitating.
**Jon Kluger:** More towards their business oriented information.
**Jon Kluger:** As you can see, the extent of the information is pretty, pretty extensive.
**Jon Kluger:** Net worth, income range, employee count, domain, the age range of the person, Are they married?
**Jon Kluger:** Are they not married?
**Jon Kluger:** Do they have kids?
**Jon Kluger:** We scroll over again, you can see the different levels of intent as well.
**Jon Kluger:** One of the things I like to highlight is we are.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't set like you'll see it low here.
**Jon Kluger:** When we say low, that's not being like that's still saying there is intent.
**Jon Kluger:** They're just not consistently showing content over an extended period of time.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe they had a day where they had a single session that they were going deep diving into employment law.
**Jon Kluger:** Medium is like it's a pattern that consistently happens on every other day or maybe every three days.
**Jon Kluger:** And then high is they got this window open, they're checking it every day.
**Jon Kluger:** They are highly engaged.
**Jon Kluger:** So I always like to highlight that because there's tools like Apollo and these other tools where they'll show kind of a bar of like a heat bar and they always have something on the lowest heat level.
**Jon Kluger:** I think we think that's silly because that can easily be misinterpreted as that is intent when in reality there isn't any.
**Jon Kluger:** So whenever you see intent for us it is genuine intent.
**Jon Kluger:** Now we go ahead and we hit download will name it.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll say employment loan.

**Matthew Kerner:** Ca.

**Jon Kluger:** Employment loan ca.
**Jon Kluger:** We hit save.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see up top here, you'll see a couple options.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll see schedule.
**Jon Kluger:** Schedule just means when you want this to refresh so you can actually have it reset every single day where it pushes out the person from two weeks ago and it adds the people from today.
**Jon Kluger:** If you go to tomorrow, it pushes someone out from two weeks from that point and it only puts in the fresh.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason that this is super nice is if you have email drip campaigns, if you have any sort of outreach that's included in your go high level or your outreach, this will constantly be able to sync and push to that additionally.

**Matthew Kerner:** So it's just, it's just the new, the new records that are pushing coming in, nothing that's duplicated.
**Matthew Kerner:** And probably if it's duplicated then it's telling you it's a higher intent.
**Matthew Kerner:** And so that's how you're kind of like labeling it.

**Jon Kluger:** And I'll show you the little integration tab in a second so you can get a vibe there.
**Jon Kluger:** But additionally what you'll see here is we also have scheduled to an ad account.
**Jon Kluger:** So meta or Google Ads enter your webhook and then determine how often you want it to update.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason that this is probably super duper nice for someone like yourself if you're running multiple ad accounts is you can plug into multiple metas as a single license.
**Jon Kluger:** You can't plug into multiple go high levels because the whole idea is if you are managing the ads for 10 of your own clients, but they don't want their own instance and they don't want all of that and white label doesn't make sense for you.
**Jon Kluger:** This allows for you to still be able to do your job using top quality data without having to download it as a CSV and upload it constantly.
**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**Matthew Kerner:** But if I'm running multiple Google Ad accounts but I'm doing the management, it's not the end user, is that where I would need to look at to bump it up or is it just doing the CSV and I create web folks and I kind of work anyway.

**Jon Kluger:** I believe when V2 is released in two weeks you can do as many Google as you'd like.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm gonna confirm that for you.
**Jon Kluger:** If anything I think if it's an extra integration might be 50 bucks a month at most.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's if it gets to that point like it's not that big and if you, if you're doing like bulk, let's say you have like 10 of each, then we're pretty reasonable with price reductions as well.

**Matthew Kerner:** Okay.
**Matthew Kerner:** And then you know one feature that I do like with with Audience Lab is their new newer studio.
**Matthew Kerner:** So when I want to download an audience or a segment or whatever.

**Jon Kluger:** I.

**Matthew Kerner:** Can have a pre filter like what are, what are the columns that I want to see versus not seeing.

**Jon Kluger:** This is the what the expert looks like when you do an export SHA256 over here.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing I like to highlight, if you can't tell, we have over a 90% match rate for SHA256 which makes it really great for ads.
**Jon Kluger:** Additionally you'll see up top, I'll zoom in for you so you can see.

**Matthew Kerner:** A little bit better.

**Jon Kluger:** Let's see, first name, last name, business email, mobile, LinkedIn, personal address, personal zip of course, gender, age range, income, job title, department, company, company domain revenue, headcount, where the company is located, Business email and personal email.
**Jon Kluger:** The nice thing about V2 as well is we will be releasing a built in email validation tool.
**Jon Kluger:** So before you even get the results we will be ensuring that the emails are validated.

**Matthew Kerner:** Okay.
**Matthew Kerner:** And actually the question was more like let's say for the window company they're Doing Right.
**Matthew Kerner:** So I'm kind of filtering through a DNC filter that Audience Lab has and then I still filter it through.

**Jon Kluger:** Whatever.

**Matthew Kerner:** One of those websites are.
**Matthew Kerner:** I can't remember the name of it off the top of my head, but a TCPA kind of authenticator or whatnot.
**Matthew Kerner:** But like for them all I need is first name, last name, phone number and like the address just so that.

**Jon Kluger:** They know where you know.

**Matthew Kerner:** Who'S calling for what location.

**Jon Kluger:** I understand what you're asking.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So right now we don't have the ability to choose the specific columns that you export.
**Jon Kluger:** But that being said, that doesn't seem like a very difficult request.
**Jon Kluger:** So let me literally message my tech team right now before I forget.

**Matthew Kerner:** Yeah, I mean worst case scenario, I mean I'm just doing it manually or if I'm pushing information into high level into a certain opportunity funnel, I just have it grab certain data instead of having to pull things.
**Matthew Kerner:** So it's not a deal breaker, it's just nicer.
**Matthew Kerner:** How relevant is the search?
**Matthew Kerner:** Like if a name pops up now you said like if I have a refresh every day takes that two weeks, it kind of pushes off the back end and it's a, it's a new search.
**Matthew Kerner:** So are we kind of talking like 24, 48 hours search intent, record capture.

**Jon Kluger:** So in turn we look as far back as a total of two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** Two weeks is kind of our full capacity.
**Jon Kluger:** We're updating intent as soon as the data comes in.
**Jon Kluger:** So if one of our data providers are providing us an update on intent, that is, hey guess what, it's they're incredibly high levels of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** It will update.
**Jon Kluger:** Otherwise it's however often you want to update it.
**Jon Kluger:** You could do it day to day and you will see new people, you could do it every couple of hours and you should see new people depending on the size of the intent target.
**Jon Kluger:** I was talking to someone from Oklahoma earlier who lives in Bixby and was looking for people who are looking for SEO.
**Jon Kluger:** Does that guy, is that guy going to see massive increase in his list every single day or a massive drop up?
**Jon Kluger:** Because probably not because the initial list was 340 people.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's all relative to the size.
**Jon Kluger:** But like I said, you can chest update it as many times as you want.
**Jon Kluger:** You can export it as many times as you want.

**Matthew Kerner:** Yeah, okay.
**Matthew Kerner:** And yeah, so yeah, so the question I get how much I can update it.
**Matthew Kerner:** I just mean how often is the list refreshed with current data?
**Matthew Kerner:** Gotcha.
**Matthew Kerner:** So you know we have noticed that the Window company is still got 10 minutes.
**Matthew Kerner:** The window company is making phone calls.
**Matthew Kerner:** I'm going through the process.
**Matthew Kerner:** They're not getting many hits.
**Matthew Kerner:** So I'd be curious how you guys feel about your, you know, phone numbers or window replacement.
**Matthew Kerner:** So probably closer to the dealers is windows.
**Matthew Kerner:** Oh no, that's Defenders Windows service.

**Jon Kluger:** We've got window repair or if we go over to B to speed.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's see.
**Jon Kluger:** Window treatment.
**Jon Kluger:** So I would probably go over here right now.
**Jon Kluger:** We can add this as one for you guys.

**Matthew Kerner:** I would probably.

**Jon Kluger:** Windows and door replacement.
**Jon Kluger:** There we go.
**Jon Kluger:** And then we add the state of Florida.

**Matthew Kerner:** You said no, that one is Oregon.
**Matthew Kerner:** And I would.
**Matthew Kerner:** Can I break it down to specific cities or areas or is it just like the whole state?

**Jon Kluger:** You can do cities.
**Jon Kluger:** What I recommend you do if you want to do cities in the general.
**Jon Kluger:** In the metropolitan area is take the name of the city, go to chat GPT and tell it.
**Jon Kluger:** Give me all of the zip codes within an XYZ mile radius of the city.
**Jon Kluger:** Then put that into a CSV without a header over here.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll see.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll switch it to zip code so I can show you over here.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll see in and then you can just upload a file.
**Jon Kluger:** You can choose the CSV and then just upload it that way and that gives you the general metropolitan area.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that is the city is confined to the borders of the city.
**Jon Kluger:** So it won't get someone who lives across city lines.
**Jon Kluger:** And most of the time, if you're a business, you're looking at proximity from your business, not necessarily the borders of the city.

**Matthew Kerner:** Correct.
**Matthew Kerner:** Yeah, 100.
**Matthew Kerner:** And then you guys do like school or something like that.
**Matthew Kerner:** Like areas to kind of learn and get to better understand the tool.
**Matthew Kerner:** So we have an onboarding video that we provide.

**Jon Kluger:** We have a dedicated Slack channel as well.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you ever run into a challenge, if you need any help, all you have to do is take a quick loom, video your issue and tag the support agent.
**Jon Kluger:** And then within less than 24 hours.
**Jon Kluger:** I usually say within 12.
**Jon Kluger:** We, we have the rule of every ticket needs to be closed within 24 hours.
**Jon Kluger:** You're given the guidance.
**Jon Kluger:** It could be a video telling you exactly what to do, or it could be just someone instructing you on what to do.
**Jon Kluger:** Additionally, come V2, which is February 15th, we'll have a plethora of videos and guides.
**Jon Kluger:** We're just making the platform a lot more sexy and a lot more user friendly and adding a bunch More features come February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** So our tech Team was just like, hey, instead of us sitting here making all these videos that are going to be outdated in two weeks, can we just make them and have it all launch at once?
**Jon Kluger:** And we were like, yeah, focus on getting the launch done and making everything perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** And then we can go from there.
**Jon Kluger:** So to answer your question, it will be okay.

**Matthew Kerner:** I think I had two questions.
**Matthew Kerner:** Well, one is going to be, you know, pricing.
**Matthew Kerner:** What's the plan?
**Matthew Kerner:** The other one is going to be, what was the question that I had?

**Jon Kluger:** Shoot.
**Jon Kluger:** So pricing, super easy.

**Matthew Kerner:** Oh, oh, dsp.
**Matthew Kerner:** Like, I think Audience Lab has like BSP saying, I haven't played around too much with it.
**Matthew Kerner:** I don't know if that even sounds familiar or not.

**Jon Kluger:** We don't.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't have an email sending.
**Jon Kluger:** We have direct mail available through the platform.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to send physical mail to anyone.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing I did skip over was actually our visitor identification.
**Jon Kluger:** So every single one of our licenses comes with five super pixels.
**Jon Kluger:** Those five super pixels include visitor identification capabilities.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you have five clients, they can each have a super pixel.
**Jon Kluger:** You'd be able to drop down between here.
**Jon Kluger:** This would identify your users, not only the pages that they visit the most, the organic versus the inorganic sources, or the cities that they're visiting in.
**Jon Kluger:** It can actually give a really nice visual representation.
**Jon Kluger:** I always like using Dallas Fort Worth because from far out it looks like one city, but as you zoom in, all of a sudden it disperses into multiple.
**Jon Kluger:** So, yeah, with Super Pixel, you're able to capture all of this visitor identification.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, if we scroll over to the right, not only will you see the address for everybody, but if you click see more, you can actually get pretty extensive information on them.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only do we know their devices, their IPs, but we're able to look at behavior and then this person doesn't have it.
**Jon Kluger:** But at the bottom, there's usually the vehicles they own or even the home that they own.
**Jon Kluger:** So why I mentioned this is you can take this pathway and create a campaign trigger to send physical mail to them.
**Jon Kluger:** So they could actually receive a postcard in the mail that says, do you need window replacements?
**Jon Kluger:** Here's our contact info.
**Jon Kluger:** Whenever they land on a specific page.
**Jon Kluger:** And you can control how often that follow up happens.
**Jon Kluger:** Every seven days, 30 days, and for how many times it happens, that costs about 90 cents.
**Jon Kluger:** Ascend with postage included, that is the only sort of direct send that we have.
**Jon Kluger:** Outside of that, we do not do an email sending platform.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't do anything like that.
**Jon Kluger:** We have partners.
**Jon Kluger:** We can recommend you to.
**Jon Kluger:** That's included in V2, as we're launching a preferred partner partner network.
**Jon Kluger:** But until then, we know what we're good at.
**Jon Kluger:** We're good at intent data and providing that intent data.
**Jon Kluger:** So instead of us, you know, stretching ourselves thin to be able to upsell you on every single thing imaginable and have your bill go from 500 to $5,000, like one of the Audience Lab customers I talked to was this week wasn't even a white label and he was paying five grand, then you kind of have that all squared away.
**Jon Kluger:** In terms of integrations, if you have Mailchimp, let's say, or you have any of these other DSPs or sending platforms, we do have integrations built in.
**Jon Kluger:** So you could connect to mailchimp, you could connect Beehive, could connect to all those different resources.
**Jon Kluger:** Do sense.
**Jon Kluger:** In terms of pricing, right now we have the quarterly promotion for V1.
**Jon Kluger:** If you sign up by the end of this week, you are locked in at V1 prices per hour.
**Jon Kluger:** Unless you say, switch over to white label, let's say.
**Jon Kluger:** But even then, if you're switching over to white label, it's likely we're going to.
**Jon Kluger:** You.
**Jon Kluger:** And the reason I mentioned that is our quarterly pricing once V2 goes live will likely be around $750 a month.
**Jon Kluger:** So this $500 quarterly pricing is per month.
**Jon Kluger:** So what you're going to see, I should probably just say.
**Jon Kluger:** No, I say cost per month in this.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry, I put this together myself.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see is essentially, if you were to pay fifteen hundred dollars by Friday, which would automatically renew every ninety days, we have a stripe link.
**Jon Kluger:** You simply pay for it within 24 hours.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm going to send you your credentials and you can just start at it.
**Jon Kluger:** You can have all the fun in the world and you don't have to worry about us nickel and diming you and saying, hey, if you were cutting off your access to audiences, we're doing this, we're doing that.
**Jon Kluger:** There's a cat.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't do any of that.
**Jon Kluger:** So we encourage you to have fun, test around, explore.
**Jon Kluger:** Because like any scientist when it comes to data, you need a baseline and a hypothesis.
**Jon Kluger:** You need to be able to test against things.
**Jon Kluger:** You need to be able to explore.
**Jon Kluger:** You need to be able to pontificate, Hey, I wonder if this is going to do better than this.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're limited to those specific buckets or those specific audiences, it puts you in a niche where you're kind of stuck.
**Jon Kluger:** Unless you're willing to Pay more, which we don't think is right.

**Matthew Kerner:** Right.
**Matthew Kerner:** Okay, so let's see what it says.
**Matthew Kerner:** The 500 is a quarterly.

**Jon Kluger:** I was going to say if you want to do annual, it's five grand.

**Matthew Kerner:** That's it.

**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to start with a month or start with a quarterly and then mole into annual, we can always do that too.

**Matthew Kerner:** Okay, good to know.
**Matthew Kerner:** And then I see that T97 has been API access.
**Matthew Kerner:** If you want to add that on, and the White Glove service to add that on.
**Matthew Kerner:** White labels on the right.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't need the white glove if I'm being real.
**Jon Kluger:** Like really, we are going to be able to give you the support if you want.
**Jon Kluger:** API.
**Jon Kluger:** API is 249 on the quarterly instead of 297.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's why everything up top is for the monthly price.
**Jon Kluger:** Everything down below is kind of showing you the deals and the, the money saving.
**Jon Kluger:** Gotcha.

**Matthew Kerner:** I don't even know what the API access does, but if you, I mean that versus Web, that versus webhooks.
**Matthew Kerner:** Right.

**Jon Kluger:** It's that versus webhook.
**Jon Kluger:** Or if you have your own custom CRM or if you don't want to have your CRM, like your customer CRM directly integrate and you just want to push certain things, kind of allows for you to kind of go around through manual work, the additional integrations or the additional licenses, or if you're using a CRM that doesn't exist through our integrations, it's really easy for you to just build it out yourself.
**Jon Kluger:** And for that reference, we have extensive, we have extensive guides on it.
**Jon Kluger:** What I always tell people is start with a license, you need an API, let me know and I'll add it.
**Jon Kluger:** Like it's, I'm not going to pull your teeth out and say it's all of a sudden $500.

**Matthew Kerner:** It's not how I. Yeah, yeah, no, I, I, I track you.
**Matthew Kerner:** Okay, sounds good.
**Matthew Kerner:** I, I also have a hard stop.
**Matthew Kerner:** I think you do.
**Matthew Kerner:** Right now my computer is actually going to die.
**Matthew Kerner:** Surprised it lasted this long.
**Matthew Kerner:** So that's good.
