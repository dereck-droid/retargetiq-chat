## Transcript

**Matthew Bryce:** John, you muted yourself.

**Jon Kluger:** It's okay.
**Jon Kluger:** I've been.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm gonna go off camera and I'll just pop back in if any.
**Jon Kluger:** If, if Matt needs me.
**Jon Kluger:** I just want to make sure I am less of a distraction.
**Jon Kluger:** So if anything comes up, I am here.
**Jon Kluger:** I am listening.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't worry.

**Scott Morley:** No worries.

**Matthew Bryce:** How you doing Scott?

**Scott Morley:** I'm good.

**Matthew Bryce:** How about you?
**Matthew Bryce:** Doing all right.
**Matthew Bryce:** Doing all right.
**Matthew Bryce:** So what, what brings you to Retarget iq?
**Matthew Bryce:** What, what drove you over here?

**Scott Morley:** Well, we're, we don't do a lot of marketing and we don't do.
**Scott Morley:** I mean our, our business model has been working with resellers that, that basically market our services.
**Scott Morley:** And so, so we're just for.
**Scott Morley:** I'll give you kind of the high level.
**Scott Morley:** We are a payment processing company that is structured around a fintech that's our own, our own technology.
**Scott Morley:** Whether it comes to integrations to our payment gateway to everything.
**Scott Morley:** So we basically facilitate payments for businesses.
**Scott Morley:** Credit card and ach both.
**Scott Morley:** And then like I said, it's all structured around our technology.
**Scott Morley:** We have resellers currently that we work with.
**Scott Morley:** They do a good job but it's also not very targeted.
**Scott Morley:** They're sending deals over the wall merchants that are just whatever, whatever that comes across their plate.
**Scott Morley:** So good.
**Scott Morley:** But it's also not.
**Scott Morley:** Sometimes they're not the perfect clientele.
**Scott Morley:** I mean and we, and also we don't have any control of those.
**Scott Morley:** I mean it's just whatever we get, we get.
**Scott Morley:** So we're.
**Scott Morley:** Right now we're in the early stages of looking into doing our own campaigning and some of our own internal business in a very targeted manner.
**Scott Morley:** People that are using potentially different softwares that we integrate to well known like Magento Sage intact, things of that nature and trying to get those merchants directly on board with us where we control that lifecycle of sales and getting them onboarded.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, that makes perfect sense.
**Matthew Bryce:** I was taking a look at your, your website and we're just trying to understand the overall business.
**Matthew Bryce:** So you own the technology yourself, you created it and now you're white labeling it out and you're seeing good traction from those people.
**Matthew Bryce:** It's just not the right traction you're looking for.
**Matthew Bryce:** So you want to get more targeted and really hone in on a higher value prospect or higher value audience.

**Scott Morley:** That's pretty good summary for sure.
**Scott Morley:** So we, you know, just, you know, we've grown.
**Scott Morley:** I mean we've had this technology, I mean we've started a long time ago in the space, I mean long time in technology world.
**Scott Morley:** Ten years we started, we started developing this technology.
**Scott Morley:** Our platform is bulletproof, bulletproof, it's tested, it works well, it's highly functional.
**Scott Morley:** Obviously we have some phenomenal integrations.
**Scott Morley:** It just the frustration that we have sometimes from the sales side of things is we don't have ways to project our growth.
**Scott Morley:** We can say, yeah, we have these resellers.
**Scott Morley:** Some months they'll submit a bunch of business that could equate to say know hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue over the next year.
**Scott Morley:** Sometimes they'll submit very little business and it might amount to nothing.
**Scott Morley:** But in when they're 1099, it's very hard to control that because it's.
**Scott Morley:** There it is.
**Scott Morley:** You know, our agreement doesn't have any restrictions because in our space that you wouldn't be competitive otherwise.

**Matthew Bryce:** So that makes sense.
**Matthew Bryce:** That makes perfect sense.
**Matthew Bryce:** So yeah, I think, I think we could be a big help on figuring out that on how to reach those higher value targets.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'll give you a quick rundown of retargetiq.
**Matthew Bryce:** Essentially Alex wasn't able to join and Nate, two very smart guys came together to bring this to market.
**Matthew Bryce:** They have a technology person who built out this wonderful dashboard that that also connects into one of the best data providers in the country.
**Matthew Bryce:** And then we waterfall that down through 200 other data providers as well to fill in any of the gaps that might be missing from this amazing data provider.
**Matthew Bryce:** But like I said, that's one of the top in the country and they pretty much service top 100 or I should say Fortune 100 companies.
**Matthew Bryce:** So to get there white label and to get this type of agreement you generally have to pay a really large sum of money.
**Matthew Bryce:** But ultimately we were able to get that by some connections that we have.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we want to be able to bring that to market and essentially give people data, really high value data at a more affordable price.
**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, what we're seeing is, is I don't know if you're familiar with like Audience Lab.
**Matthew Bryce:** Did you see the, did you come through by, by one of those ads that you saw from.

**Scott Morley:** I'm familiar with Audience Lab.
**Scott Morley:** I know the principal there pretty well actually.

**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, okay.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, so very similar offering to Audience Lab, but we're going to be a little bit more higher value in that data.
**Matthew Bryce:** Plus we're also going to be giving it in a sense of there's no caps on what you can do.
**Matthew Bryce:** So everything that we're offering in having you, giving you access to that data is unlimited.
**Matthew Bryce:** There's no catch.
**Matthew Bryce:** So I'm going to share my Screen now and I'll, and I'll kind of take you through what it looks like.
**Matthew Bryce:** One second.
**Matthew Bryce:** Here we go.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, so you can see it.
**Matthew Bryce:** You can see it good, right?
**Matthew Bryce:** No problem.

**Jon Kluger:** Zoom out a little bit so you can see a little larger view.
**Jon Kluger:** It's a little bundled for me.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, let's see.
**Matthew Bryce:** What if I did this?
**Matthew Bryce:** Does that work?

**Jon Kluger:** No, it didn't change.
**Jon Kluger:** It's still just a little tight, that's all.
**Jon Kluger:** If you do command minus, you should be just able to zoom out on the page.

**Matthew Bryce:** I see what you mean.

**Scott Morley:** Perfect.

**Jon Kluger:** See it a little more wide.

**Matthew Bryce:** Here's the landing page of the, of the dashboard.
**Matthew Bryce:** You can get visitor identification.
**Matthew Bryce:** So anybody that's going to be coming to your website.
**Matthew Bryce:** Do you see a lot of traffic coming to your website?

**Scott Morley:** We do, but I mean, you know, I don't, I'm not on that monitoring side of things.
**Scott Morley:** I mean, we don't have.
**Scott Morley:** Let me just cut it, cut right to the chase.
**Scott Morley:** We do not have a clear marketing strategy.
**Scott Morley:** We are.
**Scott Morley:** All of our growth has been fueled by our resellers and organically a lot of LinkedIn connections, things of that nature.
**Scott Morley:** But it's time to kind of, you know, we, we grew, we've been growing rampantly, so it's been great.
**Scott Morley:** But, but we have to get something in place, you know, that is that we drive the bus on.
**Scott Morley:** So, you know, we don't monitor this stuff as much as we should.
**Scott Morley:** And.
**Scott Morley:** Yeah, but we do have traffic.
**Scott Morley:** Absolutely.
**Scott Morley:** But, but I wouldn't say it's, you know, super high, you know, because we're not, we're not doing anything to drive it.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we want to start to drive more to your website and also to leverage any of these different type of tools that we have that's within that, within the dashboard.
**Matthew Bryce:** We can easily do direct mail campaigns.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now that'll be, you know, you can pull an audience, let's say, or even an intent list.
**Matthew Bryce:** And then we can easily layer on direct mail in case you do find anybody that you think might be a good source to actually send email, any type of postcards over to OR2, if you end up do getting people that are driving to the website, then you can retarget them and also to, you know, maybe offer them some type of a deal essentially through direct mail.
**Matthew Bryce:** But what I'm thinking is let's quickly dive into the audiences and create an audience.
**Matthew Bryce:** And essentially we.
**Matthew Bryce:** Either we can do an advanced search or we can do an intent list.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I'm going to, I'm Going to go with, I'm thinking let's, let's dive into the intent B2B.
**Matthew Bryce:** So looking at an intent list of people of businesses to business because you're a business going after other businesses.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now the question that I have for you is who would you say is that how high value target that you're looking for?

**Scott Morley:** Well, I mean the business type or how granular you want me to go.
**Scott Morley:** And we have like for example, one of our things we're trying to do is we have integration to many well known, you know, shopping carts and you know, in softwares.
**Scott Morley:** Right.
**Scott Morley:** I would love in a perfect world to be able to, to be able to target those people that utilize that software.
**Scott Morley:** So Magento is one.
**Scott Morley:** Woocommerce would be another.
**Scott Morley:** Sage intact would be another things of that nature.

**Matthew Bryce:** Well, right here we have just by going into the search, I put in Magen and we have Magento that, that came right up.

**Scott Morley:** Yeah.
**Scott Morley:** Magenta would be the, you know, that's one of them for sure.
**Scott Morley:** Sage and Tact would be another one.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, so let's add in Magento.

**Jon Kluger:** One at a time, Matt.
**Jon Kluger:** And make sure you expand the, the range as well.
**Jon Kluger:** The event date on top.

**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, yes, thank you.
**Matthew Bryce:** So take a quick step back in this.
**Matthew Bryce:** We generally look at two weeks worth of data when it comes to intent because you know, anybody that's further out than two weeks generally, they've probably already figured out what they're going to be going with if they haven't already purchased.
**Matthew Bryce:** Right.
**Matthew Bryce:** They've done a bunch of research.
**Matthew Bryce:** They understand what it is that they're looking for.
**Matthew Bryce:** And if they haven't made that purchase within two weeks, they're about to.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we, so we always say that we want to go as close as we can to the vest in order to get people as they are starting to search for whatever it is that.

**Jon Kluger:** They'Re looking for and kind of get.

**Matthew Bryce:** Them right at the beginning of that, of that funnel.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we always say within two weeks.
**Matthew Bryce:** Let's pull two weeks.
**Matthew Bryce:** We'll say the 14th to the 17th.
**Matthew Bryce:** Magento, wait, one topic.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yes, that's right.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, so we'll have to pull each one separately, but essentially we'll do Magento.
**Matthew Bryce:** We want to make sure that you're always going to get the first name, the last name.
**Matthew Bryce:** Let's add in emails has value.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're just going to add in a bunch of rules here to make sure that we're going to get everything that we want about of this intent list.
**Matthew Bryce:** We'll add in Mobile phone numbers as value.
**Matthew Bryce:** And two, one thing that I've seen Alex do, which I think is going to be really useful here, is adding in a LinkedIn URL.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we can really see that the people that are actually intent to buy, not only are they going to have their email number and their phone number, but they also have some type of LinkedIn and they're going to be a professional.

**Scott Morley:** Right?

**Matthew Bryce:** And then we'll hit build audience.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now you're going to see here it says depending on the, on the, on the query it could take up to 15 to 20 minutes.
**Matthew Bryce:** But generally we see that happen pretty quickly.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know, we just want to make sure we temper expectations just in case there's a lag in the system or something.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know, it could take up to 15 to 20 minutes.
**Matthew Bryce:** But generally if you hit refresh after a few seconds, maybe check your phone, you're going to the audience data is going to become available.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now here we have a total of almost 100,000 records that just pulled up with intent to use Magento in some way.
**Matthew Bryce:** We get their first name, their last name, you get their email address, their mobile phone number.
**Matthew Bryce:** And you can also see a score category.

**Scott Morley:** And what's the, how is that score category?
**Scott Morley:** What is that, is that, is that based on some analytics in terms of what, how often they're searching this or what, you know, what are those?

**Jon Kluger:** It's a holistic view of the consumer's behavior across the 200 plus data sources.
**Jon Kluger:** I always use the reference of, let's say you have a kid or a grandchild or a nephew or a niece and you hand them your phone and they start playing on your phone, you're not suddenly showing intent.
**Jon Kluger:** If they go look at Cocomelon, you are not an intent there.
**Jon Kluger:** It's only intent.
**Jon Kluger:** If it's is it's reoccurring behavior.
**Jon Kluger:** I look at it on a grading scale.
**Jon Kluger:** Low intent is a B.
**Jon Kluger:** High and a medium intent is an A and a high intent is an A plus.
**Jon Kluger:** You're going to be happy with the test results if you get a B.
**Jon Kluger:** But an A plus is even better.

**Scott Morley:** Right.

**Matthew Bryce:** Now here on the screenshot, it's only going to show you the top 500 records.
**Matthew Bryce:** You could easily hit download the top 500 records.
**Matthew Bryce:** And the beauty or download all the beauty of this is one thing that we really want to make sure that we make it easier for people to use and make it very useful is you can have this run multiple times a day.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you really wanted to, you could have it run Every single day.
**Matthew Bryce:** So it'll update every single day within that time frame that you're giving it.
**Matthew Bryce:** So whether it's a day out or two days out or three days out, to continuously always get the intent of anybody that's going to be using Magento.

**Scott Morley:** Yeah, if there's new people, there's always people looking every day.

**Matthew Bryce:** Exactly.
**Matthew Bryce:** There's always going to be somebody or something that's going to be happening around Magento and, and being able to see who's, you know, essentially who's really out there searching for them or looking for them or maybe going to their website.
**Matthew Bryce:** The one thing that I don't have, John, if you maybe that I just realized that, you know, I'd love to share to show them the sample report.

**Jon Kluger:** And I can show them real quick and you can talk through it.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** Because the one thing that I just learned today, which I think is, could be really useful for you, especially if you're going to be ramping up marketing.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm going to stop sharing so John can take over.
**Matthew Bryce:** So here is an example report of exactly what would be pulled out when you hit the, when you hit a download all the one that I just learned today that John pointed out.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now if you keep scrolling over, it'll give you all the information on them, even if they're anything about their company or any type of content company that they own and also to their net worth and their income range which is also huge because you know, the higher, the higher the net worth or the higher the income plus you're able to track back to their company and their company size that could really start to hone in on that type of higher value target that you're going after.

**Scott Morley:** Yep.

**Matthew Bryce:** And now John, go all the way over to the left.
**Matthew Bryce:** The one thing that I think is really going to be powerful for you that I just learned today is John, shed some light on what column A is the SHA256 code.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now if you're going to do any type of meta advertising that is going to be a code that has that meta is going to be able to track back to anybody and any type of intent or any type of online activity that they've had through meta for the lifetime that they've been on meta.

**Scott Morley:** Right.

**Matthew Bryce:** Which you know, since you're going to be really trying to ramp up marketing, that's going to be a huge opportunity for you because now you're going to be able to really hone in on that exact high value target that you're going after and Then you can start to retarget them.

**Scott Morley:** Yeah, you'll get people.
**Scott Morley:** You'll be able to get in front.

**Jon Kluger:** Of them with your advertising.
**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** Additionally, with the SHA256 code, what Meta does with their Andromeda AI, which is their new marketing tool that they launched across both Facebook and Instagram is Andromeda looks for commonalities against their sha256 of your converted leads.
**Jon Kluger:** So we show voting tech from the entirety of the Internet.
**Jon Kluger:** Then Meta can look at.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Of our super granular huge depository of data on each individual consumer.
**Jon Kluger:** What's the commonalities between each of these?
**Jon Kluger:** We parameters of what we want to make sure they have.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, what does Meta's AI able to identify as the key characteristic that makes them different?

**Matthew Bryce:** Yep.

**Jon Kluger:** All right, Matt, I'll stop sharing so you can take control again.

**Matthew Bryce:** No, no problem.
**Matthew Bryce:** So, yeah, so essentially, as you can see, this is, this could be a really powerful tool for.
**Matthew Bryce:** Tool for you in the sense of being able to get the, the data that you're looking for from a high value target and then extrapolate that and kind of go behind the walled garden of what Facebook is.
**Matthew Bryce:** Right.
**Matthew Bryce:** Like we know Facebook and Andromeda data and information, but if you can't give it proper information to feed off of, you're not going to get the best results you can get.

**Scott Morley:** Right, right.
**Scott Morley:** It makes sense.

**Jon Kluger:** If you want to show them how we can schedule to send it to the ad account too.
**Jon Kluger:** That's one of my favorite things.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yes, I'm just.

**Jon Kluger:** You need to use one tab like I told you, brother.

**Matthew Bryce:** I did have one tab.
**Matthew Bryce:** Right.
**Matthew Bryce:** Thought I set it up that way.

**Jon Kluger:** Stop.
**Jon Kluger:** For your reference one tab.
**Jon Kluger:** You press one button and it takes all your tabs in one window and it saves it on a tab for you.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can just open them back up when you're done.

**Scott Morley:** Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
**Scott Morley:** Is the.

**Matthew Bryce:** I'm going to try to expand it.

**Jon Kluger:** Out a little bit more.

**Scott Morley:** It looks good.

**Matthew Bryce:** Perfect.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, great.
**Matthew Bryce:** John, if you don't mind, walk me through that one more time.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Go ahead and select Download all and save this query.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's where it is.

**Jon Kluger:** By saving this query, Scott, we're able to refresh it, reuse it, and set it to the schedule as Matt was highlighting before.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll be able to see it on the next screen.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason that I really enjoy it is let's say you find a perfect segmented list instead of you having to go back and rebuild it over and over and over again.
**Jon Kluger:** You can just have it automatically refreshed, automatically pushed to your CRM, automatically pushed to your ad campaigns.

**Scott Morley:** Gotcha.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yep, there it is.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's the piece that I was.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm literally looking for the button.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm like, where is this button?
**Matthew Bryce:** I know I saw it, but I couldn't remember where it was.
**Matthew Bryce:** But yeah, so you have to save it.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now you can easily hit.
**Matthew Bryce:** You can export it or now as John mentioned, you could hit schedule or even schedule to add account or send to an ad account I didn't want to edit.

**Jon Kluger:** Hit the wrong button there.
**Jon Kluger:** You can actually click.
**Jon Kluger:** You can click the schedule yet.
**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yep.
**Matthew Bryce:** So you can repeat it every one day and then you could say it ends never and it's always active and offset dates if you.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you wanted to.
**Matthew Bryce:** Or literally just have it repeating every single day.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now you're going to continuously get that update every.
**Matthew Bryce:** Every morning or every day.

**Scott Morley:** What ad accounts are you connecting this to?

**Jon Kluger:** Is it just Facebook?
**Jon Kluger:** We, unlike Audience Lab, we do have a Google Ads connector.

**Scott Morley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** So you can send to Google Ads.
**Jon Kluger:** We're adding additional connectors as well.
**Jon Kluger:** In the V2, we're adding another 10 to 20 integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** So Matt will show you the integrations tab after this.
**Jon Kluger:** But these additional 15 integrations can be something as simple as Google Sheets or to a full fledged CRM.

**Scott Morley:** Yeah, we, we use, I mean, we tend.
**Scott Morley:** We use Monday, but we have.
**Scott Morley:** And we also have another CRM that I use independent from the company where I basically send.
**Scott Morley:** I have fresh sales.
**Scott Morley:** Do I have right now?
**Scott Morley:** You have it on there.

**Jon Kluger:** I've used fresh sales.
**Jon Kluger:** If we don't have an integration present, we have an API with extensive documentation that we can easily provide you and you can connect the endpoints however your heart desires.
**Jon Kluger:** It's a really nice document that anyone who wants to do something like that, everything that they've done is they take the documentation, they drop it into Claude code and say, build me an API end to end for my existing fresh sales and it will literally build it for you.

**Scott Morley:** We're developers.
**Scott Morley:** Those guys can figure it out if they needed to.

**Jon Kluger:** Beautiful.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** Because I am not a developer and I could not figure that out if I needed to.

**Scott Morley:** I'm not either, thankfully, but I do.
**Scott Morley:** We have, we have.
**Scott Morley:** All of our developers are in house, so they're.
**Scott Morley:** They're in California, our office there and you know, depending on what their workload is, but they, they can figure out anything.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's.
**Matthew Bryce:** That you got a Good group of.

**Scott Morley:** Young, young guys that are studs.

**Matthew Bryce:** So that's a great group to have.
**Matthew Bryce:** But yeah.
**Matthew Bryce:** So these are integrations as, as I mentioned, we have the Meta connector, we have Google Ads connector, as you said.
**Matthew Bryce:** Fresh sales in case you had Klaviyo, which does email that you could easily connect that into as well.

**Scott Morley:** We have campaigns already built in Fresh.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, perfect.

**Scott Morley:** You've got sequencing and stuff.
**Scott Morley:** So those are the kind of things that we're capable of and that we can already use right out of the gate.
**Scott Morley:** And I think it'd be sufficient to get started anyway.
**Scott Morley:** I think we're fine in that part.

**Matthew Bryce:** Perfect.

**Jon Kluger:** Yep.

**Matthew Bryce:** And then as even John said, if you had to, you could always download it put into the CSV file and then kind of like use it as needed as well.
**Matthew Bryce:** So any questions that you have thus far or is there anything else that you'd like to see or another type of audience like let me know what you're thinking.

**Scott Morley:** No, I mean, I think I've got.
**Scott Morley:** I mean it's pretty simple.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay.

**Scott Morley:** To follow.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, it is pretty simple.
**Matthew Bryce:** And the beauty of this all is, and John, correct me where I'm wrong, I'm going to probably butcher this, but around February 15th, we're about to launch the version 2 of RetroTargetIQ, which is going to be an even enhanced dashboard that is going to really be similar to Audience Lab in that sense of what you're going to see from a features perspective.
**Matthew Bryce:** But then you're going to layer on our amazing data.
**Matthew Bryce:** Plus, like I said, the ability to have uncapped unlimited audiences or whether it's visitor identification on your, on your website audiences that you need to build and even connecting it to other websites as well to kind of track there in case, you know, maybe one of your white labelers has a website you could buy.
**Matthew Bryce:** You could probably even track.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know, you could add our super pixel to that too and kind of track it and just see, you know, are they missing anybody, let's say.

**Scott Morley:** Right.

**Matthew Bryce:** Like maybe they're missing somebody that's, that's, that's coming to them and looking for.
**Matthew Bryce:** And they didn't close it.
**Matthew Bryce:** And you can kind of just keep an eye on that and maybe close it as well.

**Scott Morley:** Yeah, that makes sense.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.
**Matthew Bryce:** So that's going to be coming out on February 15th.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we do have a special currently right now as we're leading up to it is, is the monthly fee for our services and.
**Matthew Bryce:** Or for this service is.
**Matthew Bryce:** John, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it's about 750amonth.

**Jon Kluger:** 750 for the month to month access.
**Jon Kluger:** But we have a promotion running until February 6th.
**Jon Kluger:** If you lock in and the quarterly.
**Jon Kluger:** At a quarterly offering, which is just three months up front with dropping that price to $500.
**Jon Kluger:** That $500 will be your locked in price in perpetuity.
**Jon Kluger:** The beautiful part about that is as V2 comes out, you'll see on our website will likely double the price if close to it because of the extensive addition of features.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're trying to tell all of our customers right now are very eager and excited.
**Jon Kluger:** Listen, sign February 6th.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll have a week of V1.
**Jon Kluger:** Then you'll be grandfathered in at V1 prices for V2, which in the end of the day an extra week is what, $125?
**Jon Kluger:** We're saving 500 every single month by locking in.

**Scott Morley:** What is that 500 fee?
**Scott Morley:** Is that it?
**Scott Morley:** Just access to your system and whatever we want to do with it.
**Scott Morley:** I mean there's no.
**Scott Morley:** Is there any limitations to that or not?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, so I can, I can break this down a little bit.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's why I actually stopped sharing.
**Matthew Bryce:** I don't have this form yet.

**Jon Kluger:** So we have a white label option.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm sure you're well versed in how white label economics works.
**Jon Kluger:** As you get more licenses or you get more users, the price drops.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't think you need that unless you suddenly want to offer this to your customers, which I don't imagine you would.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, what is included in a single license is unlimited audiences, unlimited queries, unlimited intent list.
**Jon Kluger:** Unlimited.
**Jon Kluger:** Unlimited.
**Jon Kluger:** Unlimited in that regard, for the pixel side and the tracking, you get 5 pixels with unlimited tracking.
**Jon Kluger:** So essentially what you're getting, Scott, is getting buttoned up.
**Jon Kluger:** All said and done.
**Jon Kluger:** You pay 1500 bucks by February 6th, you get three months of access and in perpetuity, you'll only be paying that fifteen hundred dollars every quarter.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted the API access on the month to month, it's an additional 297.
**Jon Kluger:** But if you're willing to do it on a quarterly, it's only an additional 249.
**Jon Kluger:** That being said, if you don't want to move forward with API and you just want to rock and roll with the initial setup, we have absolutely no problem with packing on the API at a prorated rate for the remainder of the quarter.
**Jon Kluger:** If that's something that you want, we'll cross that bridge as it comes.
**Jon Kluger:** Matt and myself have a very similar sales approach.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't add things that you don't need?
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** If the White Glove service, you don't need it.
**Jon Kluger:** If we're working together and you have an issue, take a screen recording, send it to our dedicated Slack channel.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll respond within 24 hours with the solution.
**Jon Kluger:** If that isn't good enough and you want to hop on a call or a schedule or recurring call for four trainings and all of that, that's when the White Glove comes in.
**Jon Kluger:** So I always say, try it without it.
**Jon Kluger:** If you need it, we can always bring it in.
**Jon Kluger:** Prorated.

**Scott Morley:** Gotcha.
**Scott Morley:** Understand it's not probably.
**Scott Morley:** Not necessarily.
**Scott Morley:** Exactly.
**Scott Morley:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** I don't want to give you something you don't use, and then three months down the road, you're like, why did I pay $750 this quarter for something that I didn't use and that could have bought me a license and a half.

**Scott Morley:** Right, Right.
**Scott Morley:** Makes perfect sense.

**Jon Kluger:** As Matt mentioned, we do have this promotion running until I'll come back.
**Jon Kluger:** We do have this promotion running until February 6th.
**Jon Kluger:** Payment is super duper easy.
**Jon Kluger:** We have a stripe link.
**Jon Kluger:** You can connect a card, you can pay for it, you're good to go.
**Jon Kluger:** Only thing we ask is you email us once you make that purchase so that we can introduce you to Cindy, our onboarding specialist.
**Jon Kluger:** She'll go ahead and create your credentials, send you an onboarding video, and you're good to rock and roll.

**Scott Morley:** Fair enough.
**Scott Morley:** Go ahead.

**Jon Kluger:** And.

**Scott Morley:** I mean, you know, we're.
**Scott Morley:** Like I said, we'll make a decision soon.
**Scott Morley:** So it's not something I'm going to be delaying.
**Scott Morley:** It's just a matter of.
**Scott Morley:** I want to.
**Scott Morley:** I've got a. I'm going to my guys.
**Scott Morley:** We have a team that's doing this.
**Scott Morley:** I'm spearheading it, honestly, because no one else really has taken the time or has the bandwidth to do so.
**Scott Morley:** Just get me what you.
**Scott Morley:** You can.
**Scott Morley:** In terms of the.
**Scott Morley:** What the program includes.

**Matthew Bryce:** If you can give.

**Scott Morley:** If you have, like a pitch deck or something.
**Scott Morley:** And then I'll just.
**Scott Morley:** I mean, I'm going to sit with my team next week, and our deadline is about Friday.
**Scott Morley:** Next week.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I can do is I'll send a screenshot of the pricing breakdown.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll have a copy of the video that we have on this call.
**Jon Kluger:** This guy right here, he's recording us and.
**Jon Kluger:** And taking notes.
**Jon Kluger:** You know, supposedly you can talk to them.
**Jon Kluger:** I've never tried, but supposedly it will talk to you.
**Jon Kluger:** But that's kind of creepy to me.

**Scott Morley:** AI is kind of creepy in a lot of ways, but it's it's super.
**Scott Morley:** It's super great, but it is creepy.

**Jon Kluger:** That's why I always say please and thank you.

**Scott Morley:** Always.
**Scott Morley:** I tell it to off most of the time, but anyway.

**Jon Kluger:** Well, Scott, when the robotic apocalypse comes.

**Scott Morley:** You know, I might be dead by that time.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm.
**Jon Kluger:** Hopefully I got at least another 80 years under my belt.
**Jon Kluger:** Shoot.
**Jon Kluger:** Fingers crossed.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll follow up.
**Jon Kluger:** Matthew or myself will send you an email.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll see an email from Fireflies that includes the recording of this call.
**Jon Kluger:** Feel free to distribute that to your team.
**Jon Kluger:** If you need little sample videos or specific use cases or anything like that, let us know transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** I can't send you a sample set of data that violates their contract with our data provider.
**Jon Kluger:** You want to be like, hey, Jonathan, how many records can you pull for this?
**Jon Kluger:** I can tell you how many records I can pull.

**Scott Morley:** I guess that that does lead me to one of the questions.
**Scott Morley:** So you pulled the record for Magento.
**Scott Morley:** I see it and it was cool.
**Scott Morley:** So.
**Scott Morley:** But can you, can you filter those records as well?
**Scott Morley:** Or do I have to actually do that via downloading them, then massaging that from what I get on that?
**Scott Morley:** Or is it in other words, or.
**Scott Morley:** Or does it make sense to filter it ahead of time?

**Jon Kluger:** I always say to filter ahead of time because then it makes it really easy to push into the ad platform or direct into your CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** We want to make you skip as many steps of work as possible.

**Scott Morley:** So you don't want to have 99,000 records.
**Scott Morley:** If you can pare down to 10,000, that makes sense.
**Scott Morley:** At the same time, you know, over filtering could be a problem too.
**Scott Morley:** I mean, like, you know, it's a fine line, right?
**Scott Morley:** A little bit.
**Scott Morley:** It can be.

**Jon Kluger:** One thing you can do, what I actually recommend to some clients is let's say you want to only hit the really high intent people for your actual ads and you want to create a drip campaign for some of the lower intents.
**Jon Kluger:** What you can do is pull the same query with the same filters and add the intent score filter.
**Jon Kluger:** So for the first one you can just say low.
**Jon Kluger:** When it's low, you can take that list, send it over to go high level or fresh sales or whatever you're using, put them in a drip campaign, then everyone on medium and high, you push directly to meta and start pushing the ads.

**Scott Morley:** Right.
**Scott Morley:** Makes sense.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.

**Scott Morley:** Understand completely.
**Scott Morley:** Yeah, makes sense.
**Scott Morley:** Okay, sounds good.
**Scott Morley:** Easy, good explanation, everything.
**Scott Morley:** Appreciate it, Matthew and John and I'll be in touch with you sometime next week for sure.

**Jon Kluger:** Sounds great.
**Jon Kluger:** And yeah, please let us know one way or another if you want to move forward with us.
**Jon Kluger:** Hell, yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** We're super excited.
**Jon Kluger:** If you choose another provider, we.
**Jon Kluger:** We are not offended.

**Matthew Bryce:** Will.

**Jon Kluger:** A little sad, but just let me know so I don't end up emailing you five times.
**Jon Kluger:** Following up.
**Jon Kluger:** No problem.

**Scott Morley:** No, I get you.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm not.

**Scott Morley:** I'm not going to leave you hanging.
**Scott Morley:** I mean, I want to.
**Scott Morley:** Like I said, our goal is to try to wrap something up by the end of next week, so.
**Scott Morley:** Perfect.

**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** Really appreciate you taking the time today, Scott.

**Scott Morley:** Thanks, guys.
**Scott Morley:** Have a great one.
**Scott Morley:** Okay.

**Matthew Bryce:** Have a great day.

**Scott Morley:** You, too.
