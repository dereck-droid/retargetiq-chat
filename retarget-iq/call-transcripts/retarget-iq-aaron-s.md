## Transcript

**Jon Kluger:** Our technical co founder began his partnership with Fortune 100 companies as well as a publicly traded data company that we partnered with.
**Jon Kluger:** Through that 15 year relationship, he built out essentially the tool, the technology that we have today.
**Jon Kluger:** What happened about two years ago is we were able to get a contract with this publicly traded data company which unfortunately I can't disclose the name, but we'll talk about them, where we actually are able to tap into their entire intent database and pass it to you.
**Jon Kluger:** We are one of less than three people in the world that can be able to do this.
**Jon Kluger:** What I mean by that is I can confidently tell you our competitors leverage a data source called five by five.
**Jon Kluger:** That is where they pull their data from.
**Jon Kluger:** If you think of five by five here, our data source is up here.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we take this as a core data lake and we Waterfall enrich 200 additional sources to fill in any gaps and to identify additional intent opportunity.
**Jon Kluger:** So I always like to joke, technically we have better data than a publicly traded company because we add even more data to their already established data repository.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, now what does this mean for you?
**Jon Kluger:** Why is this important?
**Jon Kluger:** Well, Nike uses this data.
**Jon Kluger:** HomeGoods uses this data.
**Jon Kluger:** Every Fortune 100 company you can think of leverages this because it's the best.
**Jon Kluger:** And not only that, it typically costs upwards of six figures a month just to get your foot in the door with them.
**Jon Kluger:** We've been able to garner a relationship with them that allows for us to fully tap into this at a relative price for you and your organization.
**Jon Kluger:** What this means for you is massive discovery opportunities, massive enrichment capabilities with no limitations.
**Jon Kluger:** So we don't cap you on audiences, we don't cap you on how many updates you do, we don't cap you on records.
**Jon Kluger:** The only thing that we cap is each query poll.
**Jon Kluger:** You can do at most a million, which we always say, I don't know why you're pulling a million people when you want to be more granular and targeted when it comes to your outreach or your ads.
**Jon Kluger:** So essentially what we're looking at is you're looking at one of the strongest data repositories and you're looking at a better price than our competitor with no limitations.
**Jon Kluger:** We did this because we have literally a background of data experts and marketers.
**Jon Kluger:** Two of our co founders were literally running agencies of their own.
**Jon Kluger:** That's how they met our technical co founder.
**Jon Kluger:** They started leveraging the data that he was able to provide and said holy shit, what I can do in terms of my agency is incredible.
**Jon Kluger:** With this, we need to package this and make this into a tool so we can help everybody.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's really where we were formed.
**Jon Kluger:** I joined the team a little over a month ago in full capacity before I was doing more consulting.
**Jon Kluger:** I come from a background of almost a decade of working with top AI and data companies.
**Jon Kluger:** I went to school for data analytics.
**Jon Kluger:** I speak data.
**Jon Kluger:** I know data.
**Jon Kluger:** I know the power of it, I know the necessity of it, and I know what good data means and what bad data means.
**Jon Kluger:** And we are the good data.

**Aaron Shrestha:** I love it.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I love it.
**Aaron Shrestha:** That's great.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I think the intent data and just being able to have highly accurate data, it's been one of my biggest pain points.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Because ultimately we're growing our platform as well.
**Aaron Shrestha:** And I don't know.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So I'll give you a little bit of background, my platform and what we're doing for some of these medical professionals and providers.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So, you know, we sell stem cells, exosomes and peptides to verified npi, you know, doctors, right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So nurses, any orthopedic surgeons, practitioners, anyone that's typically like an MD, you know, or a DO.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So we work strictly B2B.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Now, one of the biggest issues that we end up happening is that, you know, there's not a lot of trust in the market.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So we're trying to increase that level of trust.
**Aaron Shrestha:** You know, we, our medical advisors are the, you know, legislators that wrote the stem cell bill in Florida.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So we want to get a little bit more word out there and work a little bit more on just the data and targeting the right people.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Because ultimately, like, while we care about the customer acquisition, we can use the same data, for example, on our national campaigns to find patients.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** It's kind of one of the things that I'm thinking about.
**Aaron Shrestha:** The other thing as well is to get this connected to my CRM if possible.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** And allow some of these sales reps to go out and target, you know, valid data that, you know, they can actually go ahead and call email, run campaigns on and just set it up in a way where it makes sense and it's automated.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Because ultimately, like you mentioned, you're from the AI world, so you know, how much, you know, more efficient it is having AI as kind of like an assistant.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So it should be human versus like plus AI and not just one or the other.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So just being able to offer some of these reps the ability to call people, make sure the data is accurate, email them and really make their point is very nice.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So even looking at data solutions, I'm on your guys' website, some of the couple of things that I'm looking at is the B2C data, so the intent data and B2B data or identity resolution, because one of those things can be worked for multiple purposes.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So I'm just curious, do you guys have a data list that I can pull and directly insert into my API?
**Aaron Shrestha:** I did see that as well.
**Aaron Shrestha:** But then I'm guessing that you can use this for retargeting data for meta ads too, right?

**Jon Kluger:** Bingo bang of Bongo.
**Jon Kluger:** You got it all.
**Jon Kluger:** So we even have an API that's pretty, pretty robust.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to, this is available on the bottom of our website, you could look at it right now.
**Jon Kluger:** This allows for you to actually make API calls direct to our system.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to just create a flow that actually has no one in the platform, let's say besides setting up the initial queries, you could do that and just have us as a pass through.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we do have integrations already established with HubSpot, Go High Level, Salesforce, Fresh Sales, Quavio and Mailchimp, Beehive, Pipedrive and many, many more.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Do you guys have Udu by chance or Odoo?

**Jon Kluger:** Which one, sorry?
**Jon Kluger:** Odoo Udu.
**Jon Kluger:** Not currently, but we're launching in V2, which launches February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** So in two weeks we're adding additional integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** If there's any specific ones that you currently leverage that you need, that you want to see if we have, just ping me with them.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll ask our technical co founder and we can let you know if we're going to have those established.
**Jon Kluger:** It's pretty simple.
**Jon Kluger:** A lot of the times for us to build out these integrations.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Aaron Shrestha:** And if you need something on my end to build it out too.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So I have my developer, so we can also get that connected if we.

**Jon Kluger:** Want to work together.

**Aaron Shrestha:** So that's completely.

**Jon Kluger:** So from my understanding.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me just get a little bit of a context here.
**Jon Kluger:** We have our licenses that would essentially allow for you to control and manage every element of the data discovery, be it with our Super Pixel or your audience building.
**Jon Kluger:** We also have the ability to have a white labeled version where you can have additional seats in the sense of each person has their own account.
**Jon Kluger:** Now the reason we do that is to allow for us to kind of prevent any data overlap.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're the one who's fully managing everything, you can do it through a single license and just tack on additional integrations for each of your individual agents for customers.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to be able to push Joe his regions list, you can do that one of two ways, either with a single license that you just push it over and then you go in your CRM and assign it to Joe.
**Jon Kluger:** Or you could have the API set up that if it comes from this specific query list that we can have run and refresh every single day, the API will push it over and it will automatically assign it to Joe if it's in XYZ state or XYZ region.
**Jon Kluger:** And you can do that as well.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Nice.
**Aaron Shrestha:** And then tell me a little bit more about your guys's intent data.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So like that's one of the things that people like to talk about but is not necessarily, you know, accurate or true.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Tell me a little bit more about you guys intent.

**Jon Kluger:** So I'll just show you an example.
**Jon Kluger:** This is our visitor identification.
**Jon Kluger:** So these are all people that landed on the website, right?
**Jon Kluger:** This isn't a live account.
**Jon Kluger:** This isn't our.
**Jon Kluger:** This is one of our demo accounts.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, that's fine.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** This is a live account.
**Jon Kluger:** This is one of our finance partners.
**Jon Kluger:** They just let us use their account because they have theories that they have preset that they just use that for the last few months.
**Jon Kluger:** They literally just sit back, relax, and it literally just updates every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** Their.
**Jon Kluger:** Their intent data that sends to their meta, sends to their Google and sends to their CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** So they literally set up a handful of audiences and then they just sat back and relaxed because it was so accurate and it was so consistently reducing meta costs.
**Jon Kluger:** Because the targeting is done properly, where we're looking at the right niche, we're spending the right amount.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not putting in a list of 50,000 people if only 5,000 people are genuinely showing intent.
**Jon Kluger:** And it cycles out every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's constantly updating.
**Jon Kluger:** If let's say Joe Schmo stop showing intent for a category, he'll be removed from the list.
**Jon Kluger:** You won't be spending money targeting Joe Schmo because he may have already bought or he might not have an interest anymore.
**Jon Kluger:** We're only looking at the people that are showing genuine intent to then actually spend to target them.
**Jon Kluger:** So if someone visits a website where we're able to, with our super Pixel, not only capture their income net worth finance, do they have kids?
**Jon Kluger:** Do they not have kids?
**Jon Kluger:** What's their religion?
**Jon Kluger:** But we're able to even capture their behaviors.
**Jon Kluger:** So this is where we're generating a lot of our intent data, is looking at someone's consistent behaviors and what they're doing and Then this can actually map to our own repository of information that then allows for us to look at that as an intent signal.
**Jon Kluger:** We are able to then essentially grade them, which we'll do an audience poll specifically for you.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't worry, we can do it on the B2B or the B2C side.
**Jon Kluger:** What it's going to allow for us to essentially see is a low, a medium, and a high ranking.
**Jon Kluger:** For low, we consider that a B.
**Jon Kluger:** Like if you were getting a test back, you get a B, you're like, okay, that's pretty good for a medium.
**Jon Kluger:** We look at it as an A, where you're like, yeah, I definitely want to reach out to them.
**Jon Kluger:** And a high level of intent is an A plus where you're like, holy.
**Jon Kluger:** If I don't like, I gotta get this asap.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, I work with a guy who owns a roofing company.
**Jon Kluger:** We look for roof repair.
**Jon Kluger:** We find the ones in his town that have the high level of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** We download them out as a CSV, we upload them to chat GPT and we say, give me a path to knock.
**Jon Kluger:** I want to go from each door to door in my neighborhood or my little town and actually go to the people that are showing high intent for roof repair.
**Jon Kluger:** Ring the bell, say, hey, I'm Johnny, I am Johnny's roof.
**Jon Kluger:** And we're there.
**Jon Kluger:** You see on my shirt, it's like I was driving by your, your house because I have a client down the street and I couldn't help but notice a couple of shingles were missing.
**Jon Kluger:** Were you looking to maybe get your roof appraised, repaired?
**Jon Kluger:** You know, I've got my gear here.
**Jon Kluger:** I can just climb up on the roof and do this, this appraisal for you real quick.
**Jon Kluger:** He's like, everyone says yes because they've been showing intent that they need something done.
**Jon Kluger:** So I always tell people our intent data is really powerful as long as you act on it in the right way.
**Jon Kluger:** When you're doing ads, make them simple.
**Jon Kluger:** Make them targeted for him.
**Jon Kluger:** He's doing roofing.
**Jon Kluger:** He runs Meta ads to the medium and low intent in the high intent media, people and the graphic simply says, need roof repair in Brigsby.
**Jon Kluger:** Call Johnny, Click here.
**Jon Kluger:** That's it.
**Jon Kluger:** And he sees great results because he knows people are already looking for that.
**Jon Kluger:** And we have such a great match rate on the SHA256, for example, which is column A here, that our Targeting Andromeda's AI within meta is so powerful that we on average see customers have their costs for ads and double their Conversions.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Interesting.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so let's build an audience.
**Jon Kluger:** See today.
**Jon Kluger:** All right, first thing I want to highlight.
**Jon Kluger:** Unlike our competitors, you can pull as much as you want.
**Jon Kluger:** This is just a span of four or five hours, and you'll see 3.5 million records have been pulled.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not going to cap you.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not like our competitors where we want to put you into a box.
**Jon Kluger:** Like I mentioned, with my background, the way that I've seen success in all of my different stints in the data and AI world, this is just a statistical necessity because you need a control and you need a test group.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're limited to how many audiences you can build, you never have the ability to innovate and test and explore and see what other data and what results you can garner.
**Jon Kluger:** And I don't believe.
**Jon Kluger:** And giving you a tool and then handcuffing you to a specific list.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't think that's right.
**Jon Kluger:** I think you deserve every right to test, explore, and try different audiences, different intent topics, different filters, and see which one is the perfect fit.
**Jon Kluger:** Because who are we to limit you?
**Jon Kluger:** And when you're the one who's putting up the money, you're the one who's testing with your ad budget.
**Jon Kluger:** Who are we to tell you, no, you can't try different things?
**Jon Kluger:** That's ridiculous.
**Jon Kluger:** Curiosity is what generates curiosity is what creates innovation.
**Jon Kluger:** And if you're not curious and you're not even able to test, you'll never be able to innovate.
**Jon Kluger:** So I pushed heavy and I won that.
**Jon Kluger:** We look at the ability for you to create as many audiences as you want.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's do this.
**Jon Kluger:** For example, do you have a specific intent topic that you'd like to explore?
**Jon Kluger:** We can look at stem cell.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yes, let's.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Let's look at the stem cells.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Let's look for Doctors.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right?
**Aaron Shrestha:** So MDs or DOs that are looking to purchase stem cells.

**Jon Kluger:** So what I recommend we do is we go to ChatGPT and I have a company sic code for individual medical practices.
**Jon Kluger:** Is that right?
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** And chatgpt will sit here and think for longer than it should.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Hey, you guys, Sorry, you gotta use Gemini.

**Jon Kluger:** You're right.
**Jon Kluger:** I know, but I'm.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm too lazy to switch it over.
**Jon Kluger:** Here, I'll show you.
**Jon Kluger:** Where is it?
**Jon Kluger:** There.
**Jon Kluger:** Here's my personal backup.
**Jon Kluger:** So I have my Gemini API.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't worry.
**Jon Kluger:** There you go.
**Jon Kluger:** See?
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, no, I. I come from a data background.
**Jon Kluger:** I have my four different terminal windows minimized.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now that just track me as quad is Sitting there impatiently saying, press one, press one, press one.

**Aaron Shrestha:** You're going to use Claude for the, for the, you know, local environment in Gemini online.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So that's my combo.

**Jon Kluger:** I got.
**Jon Kluger:** Hell yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So what you're going to see right now is we've selected the topic of stem cell, we're going to give it the company sic.
**Jon Kluger:** We're going to look at at most two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** We only like to look at the last two weeks of intent data.
**Jon Kluger:** There's two reasons for that.
**Jon Kluger:** Transparently, we believe that that's the best time frame in which someone's buying journey is typically if someone is showing intent for a continuous period.
**Jon Kluger:** Beyond that, they're either a slower mover or it might just be they work in the industry and they're constantly doing things.
**Jon Kluger:** Gotcha.
**Jon Kluger:** Why I also mention this is essentially what you can do in your own CRM if you choose is you could push every single person over.
**Jon Kluger:** You could measure how long they showed intent for and then you could say they stopped intent at this date.
**Jon Kluger:** And you can look at that and start isolating that and look at your own end on analytics and say, okay, people typically are looking for stem cells for about a month and then they drop off.
**Jon Kluger:** If someone's a medium in level of intent, they're usually looking for two weeks, then they drop off.
**Jon Kluger:** If they're at a high level of intent, it might be two days and then they drop off.
**Jon Kluger:** That will allow for you to understand how to prioritize, target and essentially optimize your practices based off of their behaviors.
**Jon Kluger:** Transparently, we can't store that for every single intent topic to go back months and months and months to get that kilobytes of data.
**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**Aaron Shrestha:** So it's a lot of data for sure.

**Jon Kluger:** And it's difficult.
**Jon Kluger:** You know, we love you guys, but we can't justify having a data warehousing bill that out that outweighs the cost of accessing the data through unlimited.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to just take it all and house it in your CRM, hell yeah, Aaron, go for it.
**Jon Kluger:** We just can't handle.
**Jon Kluger:** That's fine.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, we'll set up a separate database for it.
**Aaron Shrestha:** It's not a big deal.

**Jon Kluger:** So then we've got stem cells in that industry.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm going to measure for seniority because I imagine you want people with buying titles or decision makers.
**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're going to say in and we're going to say CXO Director, Manager, vp and then we're going to filter for geo.

**Aaron Shrestha:** So you said Florida, anywhere in the US is fine.

**Jon Kluger:** So do we want it do what I would honestly recommend is doing it state by state.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, let's do Florida first.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Just because that way when you go to make those assets for your targeting, mentioning in Florida or mentioning the local town or mentioning that.
**Jon Kluger:** You're right.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, you're right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So it's more localized.
**Aaron Shrestha:** 100%.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** Because you don't want to have a widespread audience when you really want to be niche in your targeting to really be able to maximize your roi.
**Jon Kluger:** So we hit build audience.
**Jon Kluger:** What you're going to see right here is it says that that's a lie.
**Jon Kluger:** We had one client who is just way too impatient.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was just like, you know what?
**Jon Kluger:** I'm going to tell them 15 to 20 minutes from now on.

**Aaron Shrestha:** No, that's.
**Aaron Shrestha:** That's fair enough.
**Aaron Shrestha:** That's fair enough.
**Aaron Shrestha:** People are impatient.
**Aaron Shrestha:** They want that instant gratification.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I mean, you're pulling out thousands of pieces of data.

**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**Aaron Shrestha:** So it's not like it happens right away.

**Jon Kluger:** So what I always tell people is check your emails, take a look at your phone.
**Jon Kluger:** My dad texted me.
**Jon Kluger:** Everything good?
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, I'm good.
**Jon Kluger:** Dad.

**Aaron Shrestha:** He'S worried about you.
**Aaron Shrestha:** You good?

**Jon Kluger:** He's probably just bored.
**Jon Kluger:** That's usually he's like, there's no football this weekend.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't know what to do.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Super bowl next weekend.
**Aaron Shrestha:** What do you got?
**Aaron Shrestha:** Just curious.

**Jon Kluger:** You got Super Bowl, Seahawks.
**Jon Kluger:** Come on.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, okay, that's fair enough.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Fair enough.

**Jon Kluger:** So specifically to Florida.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** We've only got three right now, but what you'll see is they are focused on stem cells.
**Jon Kluger:** They're in that medical profession, capital health plan, dermatology.
**Jon Kluger:** And you can actually see their seniority level, their age, and their actual deep finances too.
**Jon Kluger:** So their net worth, pretty high.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, if we wanted to expand this even further, what we can always do is we look at the SIC other health practitioners.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, okay.
**Jon Kluger:** So 8049, we can essentially take the entire company SAIC list, or we can just go buy stuff of the industry and you can just put the word medical under the word industry.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's do that real quick.
**Jon Kluger:** Why not?
**Jon Kluger:** So and what's so what's so fun is, look, we don't have to worry.
**Jon Kluger:** I can just keep making audiences together and we can just keep wrapping it up.
**Jon Kluger:** Nothing's going to stop us.
**Jon Kluger:** So we'll go back to stem cells or we have stem cell therapy.
**Jon Kluger:** So we'll do stem cells.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll add a rule, make it Florida.
**Jon Kluger:** One past the F. There it is.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me Bring this back a week like this today.
**Jon Kluger:** And then we're going to add.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's do this.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's add the job title and just do md.
**Jon Kluger:** How's that?
**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's build the audience.
**Jon Kluger:** What this should do is it should look for anyone with the word MD in their title in Florida who's searching for stem cells.
**Jon Kluger:** So now we're looking beyond, we're going much larger, not specific to the industry, to see maybe a med spa, maybe a different clinic, maybe something that isn't just an individual.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe there's a whole small private hospital that involved in this.
**Jon Kluger:** That one didn't work.
**Jon Kluger:** That one's on me.
**Jon Kluger:** I didn't put it in quotation marks.
**Jon Kluger:** That's my fault.
**Jon Kluger:** So just to be clear, this is V1.
**Jon Kluger:** V2 goes live February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** As you can see, there is a little bit of UI UX nuance associated with it.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Same thing on my end too.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I'm not worried about that.
**Aaron Shrestha:** As long as it goes live.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Like, I know development takes time.
**Aaron Shrestha:** It's not a big deal.

**Jon Kluger:** Well, the beautiful part right now is V1.
**Jon Kluger:** If you lock in before February 6th with the license on V1, your grandfather into V2 with V1 pricing.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's why I mention it.
**Jon Kluger:** But it's super useful.

**Aaron Shrestha:** What's V2 pricing?

**Jon Kluger:** Look, tonight, probably a 50 to 75% raise on a month to month basis.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, it makes sense.

**Jon Kluger:** It's a good thing to do.
**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** And.
**Jon Kluger:** And when I tell you we turn on ads and we book, we have to shut off ads after two days because we have me and the other co founders and the rest of the org.
**Jon Kluger:** We're literally at 14 calls a day.
**Jon Kluger:** This is why I'm here on the weekends is we literally don't have enough time on our schedule.

**Aaron Shrestha:** You know, it's hilarious.
**Aaron Shrestha:** This is also why I'm on the, on the weekend.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So I love it.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Because if I choose it during the weekday, like there's a chance I'm not going to make the meeting.
**Aaron Shrestha:** And I really want to know.

**Jon Kluger:** Right, exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I'm going to do here is please give me the company SIC code for all medical practices that could leverage stem cells.
**Jon Kluger:** Please put them in a CSV with just, just the codes.
**Jon Kluger:** No worries.
**Jon Kluger:** So what we're going to do now is we're going to put this into a CSV.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll upload the CSV.
**Jon Kluger:** There's going to be an option instead of equals that will say in.
**Jon Kluger:** And what this will allow for us to do is upload them in and it will actually check against every single one of the options versus if you go to do this manually right now there is a caveat where sometimes it gets a little chaotic, where if you miss a comma, if you miss a quote, it might not work out.

**Aaron Shrestha:** No, I mean that's fine.
**Aaron Shrestha:** It's just as formatting.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I get it.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** So what we'll do is we'll go over here, just drop these in, download CSV, get out of here.
**Jon Kluger:** Export sample sheet six.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, we're going to say company sic.
**Jon Kluger:** Make sure I select the correct one.
**Jon Kluger:** Go ahead, upload file six from today.
**Jon Kluger:** And then we'll add a rule that we want them in the state of what I do.
**Jon Kluger:** Boom, build.
**Jon Kluger:** And now we give it a second or two, let it do its thing.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now we've gotten 19.
**Jon Kluger:** Beautiful.
**Jon Kluger:** And just this period what we can do, as you can see, we can actually go into here, hit download all.
**Jon Kluger:** What we're going to say is stem cell, Florida, need to be intent, medical.
**Jon Kluger:** So where this is really powerful is now it's queued as a query.
**Jon Kluger:** You can download this immediately or here's a couple things that you can actually do.
**Jon Kluger:** You can schedule it to automatically refresh every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** Nice.
**Jon Kluger:** Every single day you come in, let's say you want to have it automatically push over your CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** And if there's someone who's continuously showing intent, maybe it flags them.
**Jon Kluger:** Or maybe if they're a brand new contact, it flags them.
**Jon Kluger:** However you want to have it set up within your CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** Totally up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** So do schedule to send it to your ad account.
**Jon Kluger:** So what this is going to allow for is you set this up once with a very niche list that you really like and you just sit back and you let your creative do all of the work.
**Jon Kluger:** You've let Andromeda AI dig in.
**Jon Kluger:** Because what we can do.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing that's worth highlighting is look at how accurate our SHA256 match rate is.
**Jon Kluger:** That column A gives you 90% match rate.
**Jon Kluger:** So when you target someone on meta, what meta's Andromeda AI does so brilliantly is it figures out from your initial list who is a converting lead.
**Jon Kluger:** Then it finds commonalities from the last decade of data they have on you.
**Jon Kluger:** Like you're probably.
**Jon Kluger:** You probably remember when everything used to say log in with Facebook.

**Aaron Shrestha:** I do, Yep.

**Jon Kluger:** They've been collecting data on us since then.

**Aaron Shrestha:** I mean it's always been about data.

**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**Aaron Shrestha:** So that makes sense.

**Jon Kluger:** That's why Andromeda AI that the.
**Jon Kluger:** The andromeda AI platform is so powerful is because it's literally able to then take their data and say, hey, I know Aaron's messy messaging through Facebook messenger with businesses.
**Jon Kluger:** I know he's doing this.
**Jon Kluger:** I know he's doing that.
**Jon Kluger:** I know what he's talking about.
**Jon Kluger:** I know what OC's liking.
**Jon Kluger:** I know everything about him.
**Jon Kluger:** And I can see what Aaron has in common with, let's say, pretend Tiffany, who was a conversion.
**Jon Kluger:** So these two conversions now Andromeda looks at and says, okay, what do they have in common?
**Jon Kluger:** And who can we look at that has the same commonalities and target them and expand?
**Jon Kluger:** And that's why Andromeda has been so powerful with.
**Jon Kluger:** With basic kind of creatives, because it does such a powerful job at targeting.
**Jon Kluger:** It's incredible.
**Jon Kluger:** Like that.
**Jon Kluger:** Why are you here?

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, yeah.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I mean, that's fair enough.

**Jon Kluger:** Everyone, when we jump on a call, I'm like, at the end of the day, like, we picked up on your intent for either Audience Lab, Zoom Info, or Apollo, and we saw our booked meetings.
**Jon Kluger:** We're doing it in single digits for costs for conversions.

**Aaron Shrestha:** What's your.
**Aaron Shrestha:** What's your current CAC look like?

**Jon Kluger:** I have to double check, but we're literally paying about, I think, eight bucks a conversion.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Eight bucks?
**Aaron Shrestha:** Dude, that's sick.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, because we're targeting so well.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, no, it's great.
**Aaron Shrestha:** It's fantastic.
**Aaron Shrestha:** That's fantastic.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I like it.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So obviously, you know, we can do this for a couple of different things here.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So let's take a look at pro pricing.

**Jon Kluger:** So with a single license, we have the promotion currently where you are able to do everything that we went over today.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm using a single license today.
**Jon Kluger:** If you do quarterly, you pay the fifteen hundred dollars up front.
**Jon Kluger:** You're locked in at five hundred a month forever.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Awesome.

**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to go down the white label path, which I. I love white label partners, I'd love for you to white label at some point if it makes sense for your business.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't like to tell you to automatically start as a white label partner.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is I want you to be familiar with the tool before you start using it on behalf of your clients or selling it to your clients.
**Jon Kluger:** That's just me basically saying I want to make sure you're set up, you feel comfortable and you feel ready.
**Jon Kluger:** You can send sample pieces of data to any of the people that you want to potentially white label to if that's a path you want to go down.
**Jon Kluger:** But if it's not, I see no reason to jump you into a $4,000 a month contract when right now what you probably need is only a single license.
**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** So essentially everything we did today, you can do 500amonth.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to do API access on a quarterly, it's just an extra 249amonth.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now we aren't really limiting on the API calls.
**Jon Kluger:** Our technical co founder wants to limit us to probably 100 or 1000aminute.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're doing more than that, we can talk about it and just have you run it at a specific period.
**Jon Kluger:** But like as of now, there's no caps on the API, except for we asked not to do more than 3,000 calls a second.

**Aaron Shrestha:** That's.
**Aaron Shrestha:** That's fair enough.
**Aaron Shrestha:** That's fair enough.

**Jon Kluger:** I figured it's pretty reasonable if you're doing 3,000 calls a second kill.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, yeah, it's.

**Jon Kluger:** That's probably a lot.

**Aaron Shrestha:** That is a lot.

**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, if you sign to our pricing before February 6th, as I mentioned, you get the V1 price for V2 when it goes live February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, awesome.

**Aaron Shrestha:** I like that.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Is there any way that obviously I want to like test it out for a little bit?
**Aaron Shrestha:** Is there a way I can get a demo for next couple of days just so I can see what's.

**Jon Kluger:** We can't give free access or data.
**Jon Kluger:** One of the agreements that we had with our data provider is they basically said to us, you can't give away access or data or will terminate this contract and because of the value of the data.
**Jon Kluger:** But you know, if you wanted to just do a single month right now and then roll it into a quarterly, what we can do is we can do a single month.
**Jon Kluger:** It'll be at 750.
**Jon Kluger:** If you tell me within two weeks, just.
**Jon Kluger:** Jonathan, I love it.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm ready.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll just roll it into your quarterly cost.
**Jon Kluger:** So essentially if you do one month, two weeks in, you're like, I love it.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's do quarterly.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll take the 750, we'll knock it off.
**Jon Kluger:** The fifteen hundred dollar price at the quarterly would be.
**Jon Kluger:** And you literally just pay $750 once and you'd have it for the entire quarter.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Okay.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, that's fair enough.
**Aaron Shrestha:** No, I like that.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Because I definitely want to do, try it out for a month or so and then if possible, you know, like, because the, the results are going to be there.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** It's going to pay for itself.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Worried about it.

**Jon Kluger:** And, and since we have this conversation, if you're going from from month to month.
**Jon Kluger:** And you're going to roll into quarterly.
**Jon Kluger:** If, if it, if it is V2, at that point, I, I got you, Aaron.
**Jon Kluger:** I can, I can work something out where we can.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Thank you, brother.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Appreciate it.
**Aaron Shrestha:** No, that'd be.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, that'd be massively helpful.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, I'm, I'm.
**Jon Kluger:** Like I said before is we were created by people who use these tools, use this technology, see the value in it.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not some guy who just made up an idea to sell intent data and market it as like a crazy, innovative, insane thing.
**Jon Kluger:** We are reasonable because we want to be able to help the people that actually care about this sort of stuff.
**Jon Kluger:** We want to make us a tool that becomes crucial to you and your business because we want to grow with our partners.
**Jon Kluger:** At the end of the day, when you're happy and you tell all of your friends in the industry you're using this tool, they're going to come to us.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's better business, in my opinion, than going out here and just treating you not the best price, gouging you, recommending you products that are not necessary because then you have a resentment or then you're not happy with the results because.
**Jon Kluger:** And you're going to be coming to me being like, jonathan, you sold me this.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't need this.
**Jon Kluger:** Why did you overdo this?
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not happy.
**Jon Kluger:** I'd rather you say, john, I need to pay to upgrade because I'm ready to use, use this now.
**Jon Kluger:** That makes me a lot happier than you coming to me being like, why did you sell me this?

**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.

**Jon Kluger:** Because that doesn't feel genuine.
**Jon Kluger:** I always, I always try to explain to people I am third generation sales guy.
**Jon Kluger:** I always joke.
**Jon Kluger:** My grandfather lived when he was in New England.
**Jon Kluger:** That's where my, my mom sat is from.
**Jon Kluger:** He literally would fly to China in the 60s, do a handshake agreement to buy a million dollars worth of shoes back then, and he'd fly back to America and hope they arrived.
**Jon Kluger:** Because that's what he believed good business is, is.
**Jon Kluger:** You're as good as your word.
**Jon Kluger:** You partner with people you can trust and you give them exactly what you promised them.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's how you create a good business.
**Jon Kluger:** That's how I run my business.
**Jon Kluger:** That's how we run our business here, and that's what the relationships that we care about are.

**Aaron Shrestha:** I love it.
**Aaron Shrestha:** No, that sounds awesome, man.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, definitely love to try it and see how it goes for the next month or so.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I mean, in terms of just like straight up, right?
**Aaron Shrestha:** Are you the owner of the company, I'm partial owner.

**Jon Kluger:** There are two co. We have three founders.
**Jon Kluger:** We've got Nate, Alex and Thomas.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're actually merging with our sister company, Data Shopper.
**Jon Kluger:** You've probably seen them around as well.
**Jon Kluger:** We're merging together because we were operating side by side and we were just kind of like, hey, we are using the same tech that Thomas created.
**Jon Kluger:** Why don't we just work together, everyone focus on their expertise.
**Jon Kluger:** We let Thomas focus on creating an amazing product in the continuous innovations and then the rest of us, so me, Nate and Alex can focus on growing the organization, setting up everything properly, ensuring that we have the proper support structure in place, we have the sales process, we have rollouts.
**Jon Kluger:** Remarking all this stuff that a tech guy doesn't want to deal with.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Right?

**Jon Kluger:** And we took that off his plate.
**Jon Kluger:** So the company started, I joined a few months later.
**Jon Kluger:** So I don't get to be a co founder, unfortunately.

**Aaron Shrestha:** That's all right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** It counts, right?
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.

**Jon Kluger:** I keep joking with them.
**Jon Kluger:** I was like, hey, when we merge, we change the name.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm here when we change the name.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm a co founder now.
**Jon Kluger:** Chill out, chill out.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was like, but like joining super easy.
**Jon Kluger:** By the way, the link I just sent you is our strike link.
**Jon Kluger:** If you go ahead, you can pay with a credit card, you can pay with Claire.
**Jon Kluger:** No, if you want, you can do whatever you want.
**Jon Kluger:** In that regard, if you go ahead and you pay, you email me, you tell me, john, I just paid.
**Jon Kluger:** By the way, my email is the easiest in the world.
**Jon Kluger:** It's just john j o ntargetiq.com if you email me over, hey, I just paid.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll have an account and credentials ready for you within 24 hours and you'll be rocking and rolling.
**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Can you do me a huge favor?
**Aaron Shrestha:** Can you also email this to me and everything we talked about today too?
**Aaron Shrestha:** Because I can.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I'm assuming that you had this meeting recorded, right?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Firefly.
**Jon Kluger:** Look out for an email from Fireflies AI that is not for me.
**Jon Kluger:** The recording won't be for me, but will be.

**Aaron Shrestha:** No, no, no.
**Aaron Shrestha:** You got it, you got it.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, I use Google Meet, so I say the same thing.
**Aaron Shrestha:** It's completely fine.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, so I'll wait for that.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Just resend me the, the pay payment link too.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I'll take a look at it.
**Aaron Shrestha:** But yeah, I mean, I love it.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Even if.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So the, the other thing I guess I wanted to ask you is the personal phone numbers right from.
**Aaron Shrestha:** We're getting from these data points here.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Are they accurate?
**Aaron Shrestha:** Like how.
**Aaron Shrestha:** What's the degree of accuracy here?
**Aaron Shrestha:** Can I have my salespeople style them?

**Jon Kluger:** I mean, if.
**Jon Kluger:** If you go on the B2B side, when you see direct numbers and you see these, the numbers identified there, that's typically looking at offices or personal.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll list as mobile, personal or direct.
**Jon Kluger:** Direct is usually looking at like an office direct line.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I always tell people is cold.
**Jon Kluger:** Calling someone's cell phone is always a gamble.
**Jon Kluger:** I used to do it 400 times a day before COVID I mean, hit.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Rate is low, right?
**Aaron Shrestha:** But then like when you do hit it, it's a little bit better.
**Aaron Shrestha:** You know what I mean?

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** Which we're totally encouraging.
**Jon Kluger:** We also have partners.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not sure if you consider doing this, but we have a partner that I'd be happy to refer you to who actually does text and SMS where you can actually send blue messages to people if they have an iPhone.
**Jon Kluger:** And what we've also found is if you take this list and you start sending blue messages to people who have iPhones, a feels personalized because it doesn't feel scamming because it's a blue message.
**Jon Kluger:** So you always think they have to have an iPhone to send that.
**Jon Kluger:** And it also is a great way for you to at scale, create a touch point direct to these phones to not only confirm interest, but it could actually just book meetings or text like that.
**Jon Kluger:** We actually have it implemented.
**Jon Kluger:** So when you send blue.
**Jon Kluger:** No, it's actually a different partner.
**Jon Kluger:** So we can actually refer you over to him as well.
**Jon Kluger:** It's called text blue.
**Jon Kluger:** They do less than a cent for an SMS and it's like 2.5 cents for an MMS message.
**Jon Kluger:** It's kind of crazy.
**Jon Kluger:** Good prices.
**Jon Kluger:** And we can actually just refer you over and we have an agreement with them that if we refer any clients, they have to give preferred pricing and they have to make sure not to be a jerk.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Nice.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Fair enough.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Yes, definitely.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Send that over to me too, with the text boots, because I want to get everything integrated into an overall ecosystem, just so you're aware too.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So that's why I'm looking for data partners and just being able to target.
**Aaron Shrestha:** We're having a huge push here in the next couple of weeks, especially with our, you know, ongoing webinars, educational platform protocols, all that good stuff.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So we have our legal looking over through everything.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So once that's been cleared, I want to really have a huge, huge push.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I mean, this is going to be a huge industry, right?
**Aaron Shrestha:** So that's why We're, I'm, I'm looking to see what's going to make us more effective than our competitors.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I mean, you know, the whole stick.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So like at the end of the day, it's really about data.
**Aaron Shrestha:** That's the most important part.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So I did see that you guys have like website visitor tracking, all that good stuff.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So that's going to be important.

**Jon Kluger:** Give you five super pixels per website rather.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can place it on five of your websites, your clients websites, whatever you want.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to go beyond the five, we do have the ability you can purchase additional pixels.

**Aaron Shrestha:** No, that works perfect.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So yeah, I can roll this out with five people.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I mean I honestly going to do two or three people that I know that I'm going to utilize this for.

**Jon Kluger:** I forgot to tell you too.
**Jon Kluger:** So something that's super powerful, especially when V2 goes live, where we're going to actually allow for you to do free form text and either B2B or B2C is if we go to B2B right now.
**Jon Kluger:** This is for the limited intent list we have now.
**Jon Kluger:** But I know this is gonna make your mind well.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Thanks.

**Jon Kluger:** Look what we can put, you can put your competitor, tools, competitor, tech competitor phrases.
**Jon Kluger:** So if there's a big established service in Florida already that people would be looking and searching and researching, you can actually put that in as an intent category and then target them because you know they're looking at your competitors.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Nice.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, I like that actually.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So that's definitely going to be huge.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I mean I want to start taking some of these other competitors.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I know for sure they're not doing the same thing that we are.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So obviously like our sell point is a little bit better too.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Now let me ask you, so within this, once you get this set up, are you willing to.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Would you be kind of like my account manager?
**Aaron Shrestha:** I suppose.
**Aaron Shrestha:** I know you're the owner, like one of the founders.

**Jon Kluger:** Right.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll have dedicated Slack channels.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll still be in the channel, I'll still be jumping in when it's needed.
**Jon Kluger:** But what we always recommend in terms of support or questions is go ahead and send it in.
**Jon Kluger:** Slack me, one of the other founders, our support team, someone will get back to you within 24 hours and we'll be able to address any questions regarding functionality troubles that you might run into.
**Jon Kluger:** What we always recommend is send me a loom of exactly what you're experiencing and what you need done.
**Jon Kluger:** Someone will come over the top watch.
**Jon Kluger:** It will either send you a video response that Shows you exactly what to do.
**Jon Kluger:** Or we'll give you a step by step guide.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, in V2, we'll have an entire library of videos and demonstrations and news cases.
**Jon Kluger:** And we're even launching an AI that's been trained off of all of our documentation, all of our videos, all of our conversations that will be there to support you as well.
**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.

**Aaron Shrestha:** No, that's awesome.
**Aaron Shrestha:** One other question.
**Aaron Shrestha:** This is a little bit unrelated to the targeting people.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So for recruiting.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So that's another big push that we have too is just getting, you know, people that are real.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Because we work off of kind of like a referral basis.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Right.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So we want to target a bunch of those people too.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Like they can be like micro distribution companies, companies like anyone medical adjacent that are.
**Aaron Shrestha:** We're dealing with some of the doctors that we deal with.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Is there a way that we can target those people as well?

**Jon Kluger:** So if there is no.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're looking less at intent and more just as general, go to the advanced search tab.
**Jon Kluger:** This is just a big boolean of our entire database.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Perfect.

**Jon Kluger:** So you can literally choose every single one of the different options we had.
**Jon Kluger:** You can see my dropdown came here.
**Jon Kluger:** Did I select the wrong thing?
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can literally select and filter all of the things that you want and then just hit generate.
**Jon Kluger:** The only, the only caveat that I always recommend is it's better to over filter and then work your way backwards.
**Jon Kluger:** Yep, 100.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Okay, that definitely works.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So that's a huge push.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, so just I'll wait for the fireflies, I'll look through everything again and you know, I think I want to definitely take this a little bit moving forward because I do have some marketing campaigns I'm, I'm working on here that will be a huge help for.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, definitely.
**Aaron Shrestha:** So I look out for that.
**Aaron Shrestha:** And then let's get started, man.

**Jon Kluger:** I'll be emailing you over a link for.
**Jon Kluger:** Do you wanted to do the month to month first or did you?

**Aaron Shrestha:** Yeah, let's try the month to month first because I want to see how it works.
**Aaron Shrestha:** And then, you know, afterwards I'm going to add in the API capabilities afterwards I just want to test out the data and if everything is good to go, then, you know, we're good to go, man.
**Aaron Shrestha:** We're gonna throw on the API and then it's going to be on a daily basis.

**Jon Kluger:** We love it.
**Jon Kluger:** Sounds great, Aaron.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, look forward to, to working together, my friend.
**Jon Kluger:** Feel free to give me a shout if you need anything else in the interim.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll have that email over to you here shortly.
**Jon Kluger:** Transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm in back to backs today, so.

**Aaron Shrestha:** You're good, brother.
**Aaron Shrestha:** You're good.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Don't even worry about it.
**Aaron Shrestha:** It's a Saturday.
**Aaron Shrestha:** Just hit me when you can.

**Jon Kluger:** Sounds good.
**Jon Kluger:** Looking forward to.

**Aaron Shrestha:** Looking forward to, man.

**Jon Kluger:** All right.
**Jon Kluger:** But I'm good.
**Jon Kluger:** Bye.
**Jon Kluger:** Bye.
**Jon Kluger:** Hold on.
