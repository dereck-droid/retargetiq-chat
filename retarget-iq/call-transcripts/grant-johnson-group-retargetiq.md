## Transcript

**Chris Missling:** Chris, I'm hanging in there.
**Chris Missling:** Hold on.

**Jon Kluger:** One moment.

**Chris Missling:** Off came back Israel.

**Jon Kluger:** Let me put my phone on mute.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm just making sure.
**Jon Kluger:** I always put it on do not disturb when I'm on calls.
**Jon Kluger:** And I've been on calls for the last four hours and I want to make sure I didn't get a text from my mom.
**Jon Kluger:** That's like, I called you six times.
**Jon Kluger:** Why aren't you answering?
**Jon Kluger:** Nothing's ever wrong.
**Jon Kluger:** She just likes to call six times for no reason.

**Israel Garavito:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** We can wait for the rest of the crew.
**Jon Kluger:** Chris, are you out in the Midwest as well?
**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.

**Israel Garavito:** So Chris is part of the Grant Johnson Group and he heads the commercial, commercial brokerage side of things with getting new brokers in, training them, buying some properties.
**Israel Garavito:** And so part of.
**Israel Garavito:** They also had the leases on, on a couple of our properties.
**Israel Garavito:** One of those for Dinah 100.
**Israel Garavito:** And so what really interested me and I told Chris, that's the guy I called when I, when John and I, when you were showing this to me is, is just the amount of data we can get that can help his agents and also not only for themselves, like as, as a, as a what you call like as a branded Grant Johnson thing, but also as a get data for potential people that I want to lease, want to sell, buy just from the intent.
**Israel Garavito:** So Alex, nice to meet you.
**Israel Garavito:** And John, Chris.
**Israel Garavito:** So John is working with, with.
**Israel Garavito:** I met John for my brother and John and Alex are working on.
**Israel Garavito:** Retarget iq.
**Israel Garavito:** And from what I understand guys is so generally when you buy data from, you know, these big data, and I'm not a software guy, but when you buy data for marketing or for whatever, it's, it's pretty raw data.
**Israel Garavito:** And the difference here is that Retarget gives you a data, but it ties it with potential.
**Israel Garavito:** Like intent.
**Israel Garavito:** Potential intent.

**Jon Kluger:** Another word for intent I always say is it's buying signals.

**Israel Garavito:** Yeah, like, right.
**Israel Garavito:** Is that the way I understood it?
**Israel Garavito:** So it's not like, oh, I have the ability to buy a house, at least enough spaces.
**Israel Garavito:** I not only have the ability to buy a house or lease enough space, but I've actually been looking because of whatever you guys do in the background that puts that intent.
**Israel Garavito:** So that's what's super interesting.
**Israel Garavito:** And I thought I'd, I'd connect you guys.
**Israel Garavito:** It could be really good for Retarget and also for Chris.
**Israel Garavito:** And something else that John mentioned was that it could be rebranded into a Grand Johnson Group thing and be maybe re.
**Israel Garavito:** Licensed to your agents somehow.
**Israel Garavito:** I don't know.
**Israel Garavito:** That's All I know, yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** So appreciate the intro NZ on that, on that front.
**Jon Kluger:** So great intro.
**Jon Kluger:** You covered a large, if not most of the points that we went over.
**Jon Kluger:** So a one there, that's really good.
**Jon Kluger:** Where this is super powerful is we have access to over 200 plus databases across the United States, one of which our core data set is leveraged by Fortune 100 companies across the world.
**Jon Kluger:** What this allows for us to do is understand intent based behaviors.
**Jon Kluger:** Intent based behaviors we describe as your Internet based behaviors.
**Jon Kluger:** What are you looking at?
**Jon Kluger:** What are you clicking on?
**Jon Kluger:** What are you reading?
**Jon Kluger:** How much time are you spending on pages?
**Jon Kluger:** Who do you follow on Facebook, Instagram?
**Jon Kluger:** All of these elements contribute to your intent score.
**Jon Kluger:** So what we're able to do is we're able to look at people's intent in the last two weeks and raise that up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** Because, because realistically, yeah, we could, we could go further back, but statistically, if you go beyond two weeks, the buying cycle has already concluded.
**Jon Kluger:** Usually people do their research and make their execution in a quickly, in a, in a fairly quick manner.
**Jon Kluger:** For instance, my car wasn't starting yesterday.
**Jon Kluger:** I wasn't going to sit here and research auto repair shops.
**Jon Kluger:** I was just going to go find aaa, call aaa, be done with aaa.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not someone that I could be intent targeted for on auto repair because I'm not doing research, I'm not doing quotes, I'm not doing any of that.
**Jon Kluger:** I knew my provider, I bought from my provider.
**Jon Kluger:** Now on an instance where someone's looking for a real estate agent or a home, that is a journey, that is A, I look at houses, I browse on Zillow, I go here, I go there.
**Jon Kluger:** That entire time period, you are building an intent profile that can be raised to someone to then A, send a piece of direct mail directly to their current address, B, you can take that intent data and serve it as CRM data to do email outreach, cold call, what have you, or C, you can actually send it to your ad accounts, be it Meta or Google, to run targeted ads that can easily match to your SHA256, which is how Facebook identifies people and Instagram identifies people to ensure they're actually hitting the right targeted demo.
**Jon Kluger:** What this allows for our customers to do is drastically reduce costs because at the end of the day we all, we all know Meta is a publicly traded company that needs to make money.
**Jon Kluger:** So they want your ads to work well.
**Jon Kluger:** Do they want them to work the best or do they want you to kind of have margin but not necessarily blow it out?
**Jon Kluger:** Of the water.
**Jon Kluger:** They want to use as much of your ad budget to to provide ROI while also not necessarily giving you the best expansion of that.
**Jon Kluger:** So what our tool is able to do in the real estate via commercial or residential front is we can create yes, the branded, the branded white labeled version and you can provide license access either you can pay cover the cost.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't know your business model with your agents if they pay you a fee for being part of the group or if they, if you take a commission from anything that they take.
**Jon Kluger:** I know different real estate groups operate in different ways, but you have the option to either provide them with a seat or a license for this tool.
**Jon Kluger:** Or alternatively, you could tell them we have this data discovery tool that will find people in your region or in your area looking to buy either a home or rent commercial real estate.
**Jon Kluger:** And you can either pay us a licensing fee where you get access to this.
**Jon Kluger:** We can provide it to you at a discount or you can say we're giving you this and then you guys essentially cover the cost of their licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** Totally up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** Where we've seen a lot of success is the overall cost of the platform to use it.
**Jon Kluger:** With the distribution method, we have clients that make $1,000 off each of their users in terms of how much they sell the secondary license for.
**Jon Kluger:** So I'm not necessarily telling you to go out here and charge that much.
**Jon Kluger:** It's totally up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll work out a price with you and then it's up to you if you want to provide it as a tool for your real estate agents or if you want to sell it as an optional tool.
**Jon Kluger:** Totally up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll walk through a demo, we'll do a live example, I'll show you the integrations and what's super exciting.
**Jon Kluger:** I didn't mention this in the last call, Izzy.
**Jon Kluger:** We have hammered out our final date for the go to go live for V2.
**Jon Kluger:** February 15th is going to be the next version.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to have a lot more integrations, a lot more features.
**Jon Kluger:** The ability to search any word, unlike before where we were looking at a limited intent list will actually be able to have you input specific phrases that you want to be searched for, which is fantastic.
**Jon Kluger:** And on top of that, we'll also be able to have a little bit more control.
**Jon Kluger:** There is a secret feature that we're going to be releasing in V2 as well.
**Jon Kluger:** We, we can tell you a little bit about it, but we it will be an additional fee.
**Jon Kluger:** We're still working out the Pricing.
**Jon Kluger:** So we have the ability to provide you with a pixel that captures website traffic, visitor traffic to your pages, be it your main website or your individual real estate agent pages, if they have their own.
**Jon Kluger:** We've recently gotten clearance.
**Jon Kluger:** We checked this up.
**Jon Kluger:** Every single privacy, compliancy, legality, where we can actually place the pixel on competitor sites.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you have a competitor in the commercial real estate space in your city, you could theoretically be capturing who visits their website.

**Israel Garavito:** So you're pulling that info and calling them first.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.
**Jon Kluger:** Wow.

**Chris Missling:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** So that will be released in V2.
**Jon Kluger:** Pricing on that we're trying to iron out.
**Jon Kluger:** We're either going to do it for that, we'll probably do it based on record versus the number of pixels transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** That's because let's say your biggest competitor in town is a giant conglomerate.
**Jon Kluger:** If you place one pixel there, it shouldn't be the same price as if you place one on Joe Schmo, some local dude.

**Israel Garavito:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, we'll walk through the platform, we'll talk through how pricing operates.
**Jon Kluger:** The beautiful part, Chris, is if we lock you guys in before February 6th on V1, we will grandfather you in at that price on V2.
**Jon Kluger:** I mentioned that, because V2 will.
**Jon Kluger:** We were having a group chat today.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm the one who's saying, let's not do this, but I'm gonna lose this vote.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm saying let's increase the price 1.5x.
**Jon Kluger:** But it looks like the rest of the executive team wants to.
**Jon Kluger:** The market demands a 2x increase, so we are going to see a sizable rise in price for the V2, which is also very useful for you, Chris, because then if you tell people it's powered by Retarget iq, go on their website, they pull up the website, they see it's a thousand bucks a month for a single license.
**Jon Kluger:** You tell them, hey, I'm selling it to you for 500.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, it looks like you're saving the money.
**Jon Kluger:** In reality, you're paying 400 at most.
**Jon Kluger:** So it gives you margin to be able to essentially establish an additional revenue stream, or if you want to, just give it to them at cost to enable them to be better and to identify more opportunities and to sell more.
**Jon Kluger:** You can do that as well.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't tell you how to run your business.
**Jon Kluger:** I just know we have a bill at the end of the month.
**Jon Kluger:** We got to take care of that bill, and then you do whatever you want with it.

**Israel Garavito:** Can you go through the example of people or companies that have had the Intent of renting office space in 20s because that was to me, pretty cool.

**Jon Kluger:** Let me share my screen, close out any.
**Jon Kluger:** I have no embarrassing tabs open.
**Jon Kluger:** Thank God.
**Jon Kluger:** All right, so we'll go over a quick high level overview of the platform.
**Jon Kluger:** First thing I want to highlight for you, Chris, since it's your first time seeing this, this is a real customer.
**Jon Kluger:** These are real United Capital Source, I think, Izzy, I think you mentioned you know the name at one point or someone this week, last week has said to me, oh, I know who those guys are.
**Jon Kluger:** Why I highlight this is to show you this is not some playground where I'm showing you exactly what I want to show you.
**Jon Kluger:** Izzy, you got to see me a couple polls last week where I messed up and the data didn't feed perfectly.
**Jon Kluger:** So that can happen.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't get me wrong, I always like to highlight.
**Jon Kluger:** This is legit.
**Jon Kluger:** One of the best parts about this is this is being pulled with the super pixel we provide you for your website.
**Jon Kluger:** We can pull the top pages within the website, the top sources feeding it, and even the top cities.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I really like the top cities, I always use Dallas, Fort Worth, for example.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now it looks like a single heat map to the website traffic.
**Jon Kluger:** As we zoom in, you'll see it disperses.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you have an office in downtown Dallas and you're looking okay, I want to target.
**Jon Kluger:** I want to open a secondary office to get local traffic, feet in the door, whatever it might be.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe I should open it in Fort Worth because Fort Worth is actually getting more traffic than my current office, which is in Dallas.
**Jon Kluger:** So I really like it because at the end of the day, not every real estate agent, not every broker, not everyone is going to be the most data savvy.
**Jon Kluger:** And having a visual representation is really nice.
**Jon Kluger:** This actually goes a step beyond this is our current analytics.
**Jon Kluger:** It will be more robust in V2.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll have more ability to look further.
**Jon Kluger:** If we scroll down, you can actually see the audience is broken down by income level, audience by age, gender, traffic source and device type.
**Jon Kluger:** We do have integrations, so we can easily push the content and the information either into your CRM, your ad accounts, your Google Ad connectors, your mail outreach platforms, and much, much more.
**Jon Kluger:** If you don't see one of yours here, let us know.
**Jon Kluger:** If we work out a deal where we're having a sizable partnership, Alex and I will talk to our tech lead and see if we can build that API custom for you.
**Jon Kluger:** If not, we have an API access that's included for Free in the white label package where you can easily build it out.
**Jon Kluger:** Do an API call, what have you.
**Jon Kluger:** We actually have some customers that use the API directly, pull from our data set and auto enrich their existing CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's totally doable that if you have someone who may have moved and you don't know what their number is anymore, or it's a legacy contract where the last time you worked with them was 10 years ago and their phone isn't working anymore, you have the ability to enrich and identify those contacts in terms of the date of old for visitor identification.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see here is we'll always have the contact information in the mailing address.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we'll be able to pull email, business email and LinkedIn a good bit of time, but transparently the website visitors, we have a better accuracy rate of just pulling who they are and where they're located.
**Jon Kluger:** Where it's super exciting is it's the type of data we can pull once we've identified them.
**Jon Kluger:** So zooming in, you'll see a couple breakdowns of some key elements.
**Jon Kluger:** You're going to see the name, primary contact age, marital status right at the top.
**Jon Kluger:** As we scroll down, we'll see the financial breakdown.
**Jon Kluger:** Are they a homeowner, are they not?
**Jon Kluger:** What's their income level, credit range, what devices do they have, IP address, and then their behavior across the Internet.
**Jon Kluger:** This behavior is what we then analyze to create intent indicators.
**Jon Kluger:** So as we're able to gather all the different behavior that they're doing across the web, we then develop an intent profile based off of different topics or categories as they relate to their behaviors.
**Jon Kluger:** Additionally, what you can also see is the vehicles that they own and even the properties and the value of the properties that they own.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's pretty insane.
**Jon Kluger:** Just from capturing a website visitor, what you can actually pull.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, if you guys do direct mail, you can actually create campaign triggers that if someone lands on a specific page and they don't fill something out, they automatically get a piece of direct mail sent to them.
**Jon Kluger:** This typically can be however often you want.
**Jon Kluger:** You can have the frequency 7 days, 30 days, or even a single follow up.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe you want to have them get 10 follow ups.
**Jon Kluger:** Whatever it is, you can create a trigger and you can create a follow up campaign for direct mail.
**Jon Kluger:** Direct mail, we start at about $0.90% with postage included.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to work with a different direct mail provider, it's okay, I won't be heartbroken.
**Jon Kluger:** It's just an added feature.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to provide them with that list.
**Jon Kluger:** What you would simply want to do is on visitor identification, you'd easily export it.
**Jon Kluger:** You'd identify the user path of the source and then you'd be able to upload it to whatever direct mail platform you use and just have it send out.
**Jon Kluger:** Even if it's say in your CRM, you can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** And where you have it sync with this system, you can say if they become a website visitor and they're existing in the CRM, automatically enroll them in XYZ Flow and create that automation automatically.
**Jon Kluger:** Any questions so far on the website identification before I dive into audience building?

**Israel Garavito:** So somebody comes into Legion Real Estate and they've gone into, let's say we have an open offering for a buying a building, I don't know, and they look at all the information and they don't click on like soft commit or.

**Jon Kluger:** Commit or even their email address anywhere.

**Israel Garavito:** Even if they do click, okay, then I can send them, I can send them a direct mail.

**Jon Kluger:** Shirt on the actual building that they get in the mail and they can take a look at it and it can literally be a nurture like that.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, Israel, just to step in here, is there.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And Chris, are you guys currently doing any advertising for this?

**Israel Garavito:** Chris and Grant Johnson do a lot.
**Israel Garavito:** We don't so what we do, Alex.
**Israel Garavito:** So I'm Legion Real Estate, Chris is Grant Johnson.
**Israel Garavito:** We are, we're syndicators, we're general partners and developers.
**Israel Garavito:** And whenever we do have a fund offering, so whenever you set up an investment fund, then we can advertise.
**Israel Garavito:** But before then it's more about creating contact.
**Israel Garavito:** And this is really interesting to us because we can see, you know, our potential investor profile and then connect to them through LinkedIn or whatever and kind of start creating those relationships before we need that capital.
**Israel Garavito:** Grant Johnson does a lot of advertising for leasing, for sales, for purchasing, for all their clients, for stuff like that.
**Israel Garavito:** But maybe Chris can talk a little more like about that.

**Jon Kluger:** Wonderful.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, Chris, just to jump into that point, we actually, John, you know the clue the, the call we had with Greg yesterday, they're doing some really heavy advertising.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just to touch on a point here, with your advertising efforts through both Meta or Google, for example, we're seeing double the rates on click through rates, double the link clicks and double down.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you know, a 50% reduction in advertising costs as well just using intent based data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you know, utilizing something like this on, on a budget, for example, like them with, you know, roughly $100,000 a month in spend, you know, they're spending now $50,000 for the same results that they used to for $100,000.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know that's a new used Mercedes every month for free that they are getting now.

**Jon Kluger:** No, Toyota Camry is not too bad.
**Jon Kluger:** You can get two of those.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Exactly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But to my point, and you know I know John mentioned this but I am always a really big proponent of using this for advertising.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Back before I started this with our partners, you know, I was using this for my marketing company.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's how this came to be and it's phenomenal.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So just, just, just to point that out gentlemen.

**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** So one thing that before we start building this out, one thing that I want to highlight is one of the reasons I'm very excited to be a part of this organization is my background.
**Jon Kluger:** I've spent the last eight years and my education in data analytics and AI and automation for sales and marketing.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only did I graduate from NC State and the honors data analytics go back senseless club but what I also have been doing is I've been leveraging the data enrichment and the data tools that are most commonly used in the sales process and marketing for the last eight years.
**Jon Kluger:** Apollo Zoom Info, Seamless AI, the list goes on and on.
**Jon Kluger:** And the difference between us and them is we have access to a very unique database as I mentioned before, that actually works.
**Jon Kluger:** And guess what, we're one of less than five people in the entire world that has access to be able to provide this data for you.
**Jon Kluger:** So whenever you hear or you have a negative experience from one of the other data enrichment or the data tools out there, it's because they're leveraging the same data set.
**Jon Kluger:** It's called five by five.
**Jon Kluger:** That's usually what they all use.
**Jon Kluger:** With that they then steal the data from each other and create an endless cycle of a snake eating its own tail.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what I always like to say.
**Jon Kluger:** We are the new kids on the block.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll be the first to admit but we're not new.
**Jon Kluger:** Our technical co founder has been working with Fortune 100 companies and this data set for the last 15 plus years.
**Jon Kluger:** It wasn't until recent where he was at the Gartner a contract with them to allow for us to have this platform and we sell this data for people like yourselves.
**Jon Kluger:** So when people say what makes you different?
**Jon Kluger:** What we like to say is you've never been able to use this before unless you were spending $250,000 a month.
**Jon Kluger:** So something we like to highlight with that is the fact that we don't put A limitation on your ability to pull data.
**Jon Kluger:** So a lot of people in the space look at you and say, we're charging by credits, we charge you by this, we charge you by that.
**Jon Kluger:** And your bill can quickly go from the initial ticket price that they agreed with you on to an exponential growth where you're paying out the was it with us and the white label.
**Jon Kluger:** You get everything.
**Jon Kluger:** You get exactly what you need per license.
**Jon Kluger:** And not only that, this is in a four hour span we pulled three and a half million records.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll be able to do that, you'll be able to test, you'll be able to explore.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't want to penalize you if you make an error when you're making a call to the data.
**Jon Kluger:** We want you to be curious if every one of your agents are like, I wonder what other topics I could use.
**Jon Kluger:** I wonder what else I could target.
**Jon Kluger:** I wonder who else.
**Jon Kluger:** That level of excitement opens the door to them wanting to work harder, to wanting to test more, to wanting to see the results even more.
**Jon Kluger:** Because as soon as they start partnering with us, they'll see the ads alone are paying the dividends as Alex mentioned.
**Jon Kluger:** Then the data on top of that.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh my God.
**Jon Kluger:** Like I have one client of mine who works with roofers.
**Jon Kluger:** He literally pulls high intent people that are looking for roofing, plugs it in.
**Jon Kluger:** The chat GPT says, give me a knocking path.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm going to go drive in this town from door to door to door to door and say hey, I was in the neighborhood.
**Jon Kluger:** It looks like you're missing a shingle or two on your roof.
**Jon Kluger:** Like have you been thinking about roofing services?
**Jon Kluger:** Person's going to be, what are you?
**Jon Kluger:** That's crazy.
**Jon Kluger:** And then you're like, I've got my gear here, I'll just climb up on the roof and I can, I can do appraisal right now.

**Israel Garavito:** That is so useful.

**Jon Kluger:** Something as simple as that.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't need to have a team of door to door sales guys anymore blindly knocking.
**Jon Kluger:** Instead you give them a list of high intent targets that have literally shown that they need a new roof.
**Jon Kluger:** So this is all great and all.
**Jon Kluger:** We can talk through everything or I can just show you.
**Jon Kluger:** I like to show.
**Jon Kluger:** With that being said, what you're going to see on the homepage here is a couple of different intent ways.
**Jon Kluger:** The first one is advanced search.
**Jon Kluger:** Think of advanced search as LinkedIn.
**Jon Kluger:** It's a Boolean search.
**Jon Kluger:** You do and.
**Jon Kluger:** Or you create the dropdowns and nope, I complicated that.
**Jon Kluger:** I hit group.
**Jon Kluger:** You just select your Fields and you hit go.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're looking for wealthy individuals in a C level position that own a home, go.
**Jon Kluger:** This has nothing to do with intent.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to do intent, we look at the B2C or we look at the B2B to C. Obviously targeting the consumer.
**Jon Kluger:** So someone looking to rent, someone looking to buy, someone looking to have someone sell their home, whatever it might be, is the B2C.
**Jon Kluger:** We look at B2.
**Jon Kluger:** B2B is where we evaluate.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, this business needs commercial office space.
**Jon Kluger:** This business needs janitorial services.
**Jon Kluger:** This business is using this software.
**Jon Kluger:** All of those are search terms for B2B.
**Jon Kluger:** As I mentioned before, I mentioned this to Izzy in passing, but in B2 that goes live February 15th, you no longer will have a dropdown.
**Jon Kluger:** The dropdown will auto populate as you search, but you can just hit enter.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't need to select from the list so you can put the exact phrase, the exact topic, the exact keyword that you want.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't have to worry about the confines bars until then.
**Jon Kluger:** If there's ones that you guys need and it's a make or break for you guys, we can make, we can work with our technical team and work on that for you as well.
**Jon Kluger:** What I always just recommend is hey, just come aboard next Friday, take a week to get familiar and then everything will roll out.
**Jon Kluger:** We just have the promotional pricing until February 6th because we have to tell all of our customers if you're going to do V1, we want to honor that.
**Jon Kluger:** You can do a week on V1, we'll roll you into V2 at that price.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's do an example.
**Jon Kluger:** We're going to first take a two week window for the intent.
**Jon Kluger:** As we discussed before, two weeks is the furthest we want to look back.
**Jon Kluger:** If someone consistently appears in the auto updated queries, then we can mark them as their initial instance to when they're removed.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's one of the cool parts, is we can set a query that auto updates be it every day, every week, every month.
**Jon Kluger:** You could literally have it update every day.
**Jon Kluger:** Push to your CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** The new contacts in the CRM are your call list for that day.
**Jon Kluger:** So it doesn't have to be overly complicated.
**Jon Kluger:** If you just want to do it every day and find the first to say the hundred people that come up, distribute them among agents, or if it's an agent who set up this, it's distributed to them.
**Jon Kluger:** Then they can work them however they'd like.
**Jon Kluger:** So first things we've done is we've set the intent time.
**Jon Kluger:** Do we want to look at B2B or B2C first?
**Jon Kluger:** Chris, what would be useful for you?
**Jon Kluger:** You're on mute if you didn't know, FYI.

**Chris Missling:** Okay.
**Chris Missling:** Sorry about that.

**Jon Kluger:** No worries.
**Jon Kluger:** I haven't been ignoring you.
**Jon Kluger:** If you've been talking.
**Jon Kluger:** By the way, you've just been on mute this entire.

**Chris Missling:** That's okay.
**Chris Missling:** Yeah, yeah.
**Chris Missling:** What was the option?

**Jon Kluger:** So either B to C would be end consumer.
**Jon Kluger:** So if your agents were looking for people who are buying, selling, or renting, that's B2C.
**Jon Kluger:** B to B would say commercial.
**Jon Kluger:** So we'll go over to B2C.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll set a time frame.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll say do you want to do renting?
**Jon Kluger:** Buying or leasing?
**Jon Kluger:** We can do or selling even.
**Jon Kluger:** Which one would you like to start with?

**Chris Missling:** Let's start with leasing.

**Jon Kluger:** Leasing services or just general leasing?

**Chris Missling:** General leasing.

**Jon Kluger:** Next, what we want to do is we'll select.
**Jon Kluger:** This is just my.
**Jon Kluger:** My mental logic.
**Jon Kluger:** Homeowner will say in and we'll say no.
**Jon Kluger:** And then this will say, hey, anyone who doesn't own a home, which is obviously leasers or renters.

**Chris Missling:** Yep.

**Jon Kluger:** Is there a specific state, region, city that you want to take a look at?
**Jon Kluger:** Let's see.

**Chris Missling:** Region.

**Jon Kluger:** So by region I mean is like metropolitan area.
**Jon Kluger:** Because if you just select city, you're going to be confined to the borders of the city.
**Jon Kluger:** Where if I say region, you.
**Jon Kluger:** You take that city, you plug it into chat GPT, you say, give me every zip code within a 50 mile radius of the city in a CSV.
**Jon Kluger:** Then you can easily upload that CSV.
**Jon Kluger:** So it makes it super easy that way.

**Chris Missling:** Yeah, I was thinking like a region.

**Jon Kluger:** Like we can do multiple states.

**Chris Missling:** Okay.
**Chris Missling:** No, well, no, actually I was looking at county.
**Chris Missling:** County, like, so let's say Hennepin County.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, you can do this.

**Chris Missling:** Would that work?

**Jon Kluger:** Or how do I spell that?
**Jon Kluger:** Hence H. What?

**Chris Missling:** H E N, N E P. I.

**Jon Kluger:** N P. I said B.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry.
**Jon Kluger:** Please provide all zip codes as just their zip code number in a CSV for Hen County.

**Chris Missling:** Minnesota.

**Israel Garavito:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Hell yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** I feel.
**Jon Kluger:** I feel good without getting hit with autocorrect when I don't mess up somewhere.

**Israel Garavito:** You got that might take a little bit.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, yeah, Control.
**Jon Kluger:** I said auto.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so this will just spit out the list in the CSV format.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll show you that in one moment.
**Jon Kluger:** Once it decides it wants to work with me, it's got performance anxiety, I swear to God.

**Israel Garavito:** Can do by city.
**Israel Garavito:** Like.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, so you can throw in the cities with the city.
**Jon Kluger:** I just always recommend Saying a radius of the city that you serve so that we don't miss anyone who say in the suburbs and then wants to move into the city because we want that.
**Jon Kluger:** What I will say is when we look at V2 and V2 coastline, you can literally say the city.
**Jon Kluger:** So Minneapolis Apartments for rent.
**Jon Kluger:** So now that we have the CSV of all of these, you just simply copy it, go to a tab in any format, paste it in, make sure there's no text.
**Jon Kluger:** Perfect file, download as CSV.
**Jon Kluger:** Now over here we'll select the zip instead of equal.
**Jon Kluger:** Going to select in.
**Jon Kluger:** In is just looking at your CSV.
**Jon Kluger:** Should be.
**Jon Kluger:** This one.
**Jon Kluger:** Now here's additional rules.
**Jon Kluger:** Are there anything else that you want to look at?
**Jon Kluger:** We can look at ensuring that they have a LinkedIn URL.
**Jon Kluger:** We can ensure that they have a mobile phone number.
**Jon Kluger:** We can ensure that any of these values to make life easy for this one, why don't we do that?
**Jon Kluger:** We ensure that we have their mobile number.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you're, if you're has mobile, sorry.

**Israel Garavito:** Maybe income.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we can do income.
**Jon Kluger:** There we are.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll say is in.
**Jon Kluger:** And then we can do above or beyond certain thresholds.
**Jon Kluger:** So if we're looking at leasing, I imagine it would be people who make less than $200,000 a year.
**Jon Kluger:** Would that be fair?

**Chris Missling:** I would say maybe the next one.
**Chris Missling:** Okay, let's see what happens.

**Jon Kluger:** And not less than 20,000, because less than 20,000 is not exactly a fancy apartment by any means.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're going to hit build audience.
**Jon Kluger:** This is going to say 15 to 20 minutes.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a lie.
**Jon Kluger:** We had a couple customers.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, it was one guy who was like, why isn't an instant.
**Jon Kluger:** Why isn't it instant?
**Jon Kluger:** He starts just freaking out.
**Jon Kluger:** So we decided to set a 15 to 20 minute range.
**Jon Kluger:** Just like how an IT guy goes and try to unplug it and plug it back in.
**Jon Kluger:** We like to say, have you waited 15 minutes?
**Jon Kluger:** And refresh the page.
**Jon Kluger:** In reality, how long it takes is enough time for you to check your email or check your phone.
**Jon Kluger:** You hit refresh, it should be loading.
**Jon Kluger:** So see, this one was such an extensive poll since we went through so many zip codes.
**Jon Kluger:** Just takes an extra minute or two.
**Jon Kluger:** It's in queue.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me pull it up.
**Jon Kluger:** There we go.
**Jon Kluger:** It's completed, so it should be left.
**Jon Kluger:** There we go.
**Jon Kluger:** So for this specific poll with those specific filters, we're seeing 210 people have shown intent in this short period of time.
**Jon Kluger:** The really nice part about this is, as you can see, none of Them are homeowners.
**Jon Kluger:** What I would also recommend if we did this poll again, you can say probable.
**Jon Kluger:** Yes for homeowner, 9 out of 10 it's a 5050 play with the probable.
**Jon Kluger:** So it doesn't hurt to do probable.
**Jon Kluger:** That would expand the list quite a good bit.
**Jon Kluger:** You can also just say no to homeowner.
**Jon Kluger:** So whatever yes statements we could do, we can also do as a no.
**Jon Kluger:** So this list could easily be larger.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see here right away is name, contact information and address.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, if we scroll over right, which it's not letting me do right now, but you'll be able to see their LinkedIn URL, their business information.
**Jon Kluger:** And then on the far right over there, which for some reason I'm not being able to scroll right now, you'll see the revenue of the business and the money that they can make.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, what does this look like if we break it down into an export?
**Jon Kluger:** So you'll see the SHA256 which is the unique identifier that meta leverages to match your profile to their version of your profile.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason that that is so important to understand is SHA256 codes meta established when they first built a profile about you.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't know when everyone made their Facebook or Instagram, but it's at least 10 years for me at this point.
**Jon Kluger:** Over those 10 years, they've developed their own data profile about you.
**Jon Kluger:** They know the nuance of you, they know what you comment on, they know who you interact with.
**Jon Kluger:** That's why they're a trillion dollar company.
**Jon Kluger:** What they can use this data for is finding a unique identifier that matches a key characteristic of the profile from the list that we provide.
**Jon Kluger:** So we provide meta, say 210 contacts to then run ads at the people that go into that ad, click and convert.
**Jon Kluger:** Meta then is going to analyze and say okay, of these people, what do they have in common from my database, what behaviors do they share on Instagram or on Facebook that I can now duplicate?
**Jon Kluger:** So our intent shows those people that match in this moment.
**Jon Kluger:** What meta then allows for you to do is it expands it to then identify people that have the exact same behaviors as a person that converted within that list, which we already know is a high intent, which should yield higher conversions and they're able to find their versions of people that match that appearance.
**Jon Kluger:** So what it does is it with a simple piece of creative with last time.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't know if I did this for you, Izzy.
**Jon Kluger:** Could be as something as simple as pulling it up on ChatGPT and asking.
**Jon Kluger:** But our ad literally reads, we book 10, 20 meetings a day.
**Jon Kluger:** Our ad literally says, are you using this software?
**Jon Kluger:** We are.
**Jon Kluger:** Better data for less.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't overcomplicate it.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't add the bells and whistles.
**Jon Kluger:** We know what these people are looking for.
**Jon Kluger:** Looking for a new lease on your apartment.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, what they're going to do is display that message to that group.
**Jon Kluger:** Anyone that converts off of that, they will duplicate those efforts to find people that match that demographic on an even deeper level.
**Jon Kluger:** That is how we're able to achieve such a reduction in ad spend is because I guarantee you these 210 intent based, intent based, identified people will convert and be a better use of money than if it was a 10, 000 person list with no intent data.

**Israel Garavito:** Can we do an example of people or small businesses that are intending to lease new office space?

**Jon Kluger:** Sure, that one.
**Jon Kluger:** Next.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me just do one thing, you see, and I got you.
**Jon Kluger:** So one thing to also highlight with this audience data.
**Jon Kluger:** If we say download all and we say leasing for region and we'll say income over 25k, We hit save.
**Jon Kluger:** What we now can do is up here in actions.
**Jon Kluger:** We can schedule this to refresh every single day if you want, we can schedule this to refresh every week.
**Jon Kluger:** However often you want the intent data to update and push out the previous set, we can do not only that, to actually schedule to send it to your ad account.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's find, let's say you find a query that you leverage it and you start running ads and it's killing it.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't want to sit there on the same list if your ads are doing really well.
**Jon Kluger:** Because as we discussed before, intent fades.
**Jon Kluger:** What you want to do is you want to maintain the people that maintain that level of intent or the people that have suddenly had that level of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** By scheduling it, you could have it every single day pushing and refreshing and optimizing your lead lists for your ads.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, if someone is continuously showing intent over that period of time, they won't be removed.
**Jon Kluger:** But once their intent period passes, then there's no point in spending money on someone who's already bought or signed or done something.
**Jon Kluger:** So this helps you save on your ad spend because I can't tell you how many times I've worked with a marketing group who they go and they set up an ad once and they go, it's doing okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Do they get a new set of data?
**Jon Kluger:** No, they usually go, well, we need a new creative, not the creative that's the issue half the time to the data.
**Jon Kluger:** You're using outdated data because someone leased something, they're not going to need another lease for at least a year.
**Jon Kluger:** So going back to what you had requested, Izzy, create audience.
**Jon Kluger:** Go to B2B.
**Jon Kluger:** We have office.
**Jon Kluger:** Move Office space.

**Israel Garavito:** Office space.
**Israel Garavito:** Office space would be good.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, I want to confirm that that's the office space.
**Jon Kluger:** I think there it is.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** I saw one that was the words together.
**Jon Kluger:** Is that for the movie?

**Israel Garavito:** I don't know.
**Israel Garavito:** Office space.

**Jon Kluger:** So we'll do it for the same time frame.
**Jon Kluger:** Select the field of.

**Israel Garavito:** So like business size.
**Israel Garavito:** Because we can't.
**Israel Garavito:** We have max 20,000 square feet.
**Israel Garavito:** So maybe what, 50 employees in.

**Jon Kluger:** What's the minimum.

**Israel Garavito:** One probably one to.
**Israel Garavito:** Well, no, let's do 11.
**Israel Garavito:** Let's do 11 as a minimum to 100 to 50.
**Israel Garavito:** 1,000 to 50.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Israel Garavito:** Let's put it nice and tight.

**Jon Kluger:** And then should we use the same location.

**Israel Garavito:** Put.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we can just upload.

**Israel Garavito:** Let's do the same location.
**Israel Garavito:** Yeah.
**Israel Garavito:** It's happen.
**Israel Garavito:** County.
**Israel Garavito:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Stay at 432.
**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.

**Israel Garavito:** Maybe also add St. Paul as a city.
**Israel Garavito:** St. Paul, Minnesota, which is different.

**Jon Kluger:** So if we add St. Paul and we already have the zip codes, it looks for an overlap.

**Israel Garavito:** Oh, okay.
**Israel Garavito:** Never mind.
**Israel Garavito:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So then what we can also do is if you want to get granular, let's.

**Israel Garavito:** I think that's granular enough.

**Jon Kluger:** Company.
**Jon Kluger:** Do we want to make sure that they're making money?
**Jon Kluger:** No, let's just.

**Israel Garavito:** What it looks like for the B2B said.
**Israel Garavito:** Yeah.
**Israel Garavito:** For companies that want to or have been looking for office space.

**Jon Kluger:** So the intent of what we essentially said is exactly that.
**Jon Kluger:** Izzy.
**Jon Kluger:** People between 11 to 50.
**Jon Kluger:** Companies that have 11 to 50 employees, they are showing intent for office space.
**Jon Kluger:** And they exist in these zip codes, the ones that we use for the last one.
**Jon Kluger:** Go ahead and refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** Come on.
**Jon Kluger:** It's just in progress.
**Jon Kluger:** Once that's completed, we'll be able to show.
**Jon Kluger:** But as you can see, we identified 129 contacts.
**Jon Kluger:** These contacts are going to be very specific to that specific need.
**Jon Kluger:** And it's going to be indicated that the content in which context.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me.
**Jon Kluger:** In which they are searching office space is related to a B2B front.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me see if it's okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** It's still in queue.
**Jon Kluger:** We must have a couple people online right now.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, it's because.
**Jon Kluger:** Matt, sorry.
**Jon Kluger:** One of our.
**Jon Kluger:** One of our trainees is on.
**Jon Kluger:** The two of our trainees is using this instance right now to test some stuff.
**Jon Kluger:** So they might be Bogging us down a little bit.
**Jon Kluger:** There we go.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's preview.
**Jon Kluger:** So what you'll see here.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're going to see Mark Bertram.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm going to slide this over here because my screen is acting up so it's not letting me.
**Jon Kluger:** My computer is acting up so I can't show you.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not scrolling for me.
**Jon Kluger:** But what you can see is this is all of the business information that we're pulling.
**Jon Kluger:** On this right side here you'll see the LinkedIn, where they're from, the website, the industry they're operating in, the number of headcount of employees, the title and the role of the person, their contact information, everything that you could need.
**Jon Kluger:** Wealth architects here, Financial planning assistant are looking for office space.
**Jon Kluger:** Senior consultant, the owner of Sprung, made by Sprung.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not, I'm not super familiar with what that is, but this consultancy group with the company secretary, I wonder who the secretary is looking up office space for.
**Jon Kluger:** All of these different things are now pulled on a B2B basis and you're able to do direct outreach, be it through LinkedIn, automation, email, et cetera.
**Jon Kluger:** The nice part about this is just like the last one.
**Jon Kluger:** If we hit download all and we save it as a query, you can update daily, can update weekly and it can push to your ad accounts.
**Jon Kluger:** Now that's a very high level overview.
**Jon Kluger:** What's super exciting about the platform too is as I mentioned, you can have this simple integration here.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say you don't.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say, Chris, you want to make this a tool for your, your current real estate agents and you want them to run their own meta ads or you want someone else to manage the meta ads.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want us to make the meta connector disappear so they can't connect in and mess things up, we can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want the HubSpot connection not to exist, disappear, we can take care of that fully customizable with the white label option.
**Jon Kluger:** What would happen is up here it would be Grant Johnson Real Estate or Grant Johnson Group, whichever nomenclature you prefer.
**Jon Kluger:** You would give each instance.
**Jon Kluger:** So each real estate agent would have their own login.
**Jon Kluger:** If do you use Go High Level or what do you use for your CRM tool?
**Jon Kluger:** Is it a native build, industry specific?

**Israel Garavito:** Yeah.

**Chris Missling:** Right now we use Follow Up Boss.

**Jon Kluger:** Follow Up Boss.
**Jon Kluger:** All right, Alex, that's our CRM that.

**Chris Missling:** We'Re using right now.

**Jon Kluger:** Follow Up Boss is the name.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll circle up with Thomas and see if he's familiar with Follow Up Boss for sure.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, we currently don't have that integration, guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But just as John mentioned earlier, we're always working with our users.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So at any point, if somebody joins, like I'm literally looking at an email right now, somebody wants features, you know.

**Jon Kluger:** And asking if they're possible.

**Alex Ciereszko:** We're always adding those features and trying our best to just make the platform better and better.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because at the end of the day, if we can keep listening to what people want and you know, there is going to come a point where all the features and lines are crossed and it works for everybody.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's the goal and that's what's going to make us the best platform out there.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** And as we mentioned before, a white label includes API.
**Jon Kluger:** So in the interim, if you just want to do an API poll that just syncs the data over, it's super duper easy.
**Jon Kluger:** Our documentation is available at the bottom of our website, so you can easily see it.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you need that asap, you know, I'm sure we'd be able to have that conversation.
**Jon Kluger:** In terms of what it looks like for you guys, pricing wise and how we operate, I brought, I brought the big man up top, which is Alex.
**Jon Kluger:** So if we need to negotiate, I don't have to go run and ask him.
**Jon Kluger:** I get clearance.
**Jon Kluger:** Now what we look at on the white label side is we have a starting price of 3,000 on an annual agreement that comes with 10 licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** Unlimited, unlimited, unlimited 5 pixels for each of those licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** So that can cover five websites, be it main company or individual.
**Jon Kluger:** You get API access included.
**Jon Kluger:** And what's really nice is once you exceed 10 licenses, which I'm sure you can like that because you have a bunch of agents, let's say we do 50, your average cost per license drastically drops because after the 10th license, it's just a hundred dollars after that.
**Jon Kluger:** So because of that it allows for you.
**Jon Kluger:** So now we're looking at $150 if you pay a month to month to us that each license cost you.
**Jon Kluger:** On our website, this license as of February 15th will be listed as over $750.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can either say, I'm giving you XYZ value for 150 bucks and break even, or you can say I'm selling it to you for 300 bucks.
**Jon Kluger:** However you want to set it up, you have full control over that.
**Jon Kluger:** All we care about at the end of the day is it works, you're happy, and of course we get paid.
**Jon Kluger:** That being said, you know, not only does the website currently run the promotion at 500 for a single license, which even if you don't add a single additional license, the most you could possibly pay, you still have a hundred dollars in margin per account if you wanted to pass that cost on to anybody else.
**Jon Kluger:** Any thoughts so far?
**Jon Kluger:** I just, I always like to get a pulse, check to see what you guys are thinking.

**Israel Garavito:** So for like, for some.
**Israel Garavito:** For Legion, we're looking at 750amonth on.

**Jon Kluger:** A month to month.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have.
**Jon Kluger:** If it's just you, Izzy.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** If you pay it all.
**Jon Kluger:** If you pay fifteen hundred dollars up front, you get three months, which is equivalent to five hundred a month.
**Jon Kluger:** Or if you do it on the annual, it's 417.

**Israel Garavito:** Okay, I gotta get Mark in here also with you.

**Jon Kluger:** Maybe next week.
**Jon Kluger:** That works.
**Jon Kluger:** Chris, on your end, I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about it.
**Jon Kluger:** If anything, this jumps out to you as a tool that A, you think would be beneficial.
**Jon Kluger:** But B, in terms of where we're at price and instance wise, I just want to make sure that I'm not coming at you with a crazy number or something.

**Chris Missling:** No, no, thank.
**Chris Missling:** Yeah.
**Chris Missling:** Thank you for the presentation.
**Chris Missling:** It was very, well, informative.
**Chris Missling:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.

**Chris Missling:** It's something that I have to kind of have to defer to Grant Johnson because he is, you know, he's our CEO.
**Chris Missling:** And the thing about what he has going on, like, I don't know, all the sourcing and lead generation that he currently has set up, but I know what he has set up right now is it's very robust for what he has already currently.

**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**Chris Missling:** He's getting an average of 100 to 200 incoming leads per week just on his team alone.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Chris Missling:** Well, he has a high volume of something that's set up that I, you know, I don't know what it is yet.
**Chris Missling:** So this is brand new.
**Chris Missling:** So I would have to, you know, and I don't know why he's not on the call today.

**Alex Ciereszko:** He.

**Jon Kluger:** He might have great news, Chris.
**Jon Kluger:** Recorded by Firefly AI Anyone.
**Jon Kluger:** Anyone who RSVP yes to it will actually get a reporting of this call.
**Jon Kluger:** So wants to go back and take a.
**Jon Kluger:** Take a watch at it and then we follow up and have a deeper conversation.
**Jon Kluger:** We're totally open to that.
**Jon Kluger:** If he has a system or a structure in place that he needs very specific setups or nuances.
**Jon Kluger:** I recommend we have the API.
**Jon Kluger:** You can find the API at the bottom of our website.
**Jon Kluger:** Super duper easy to find what we can also always do.
**Jon Kluger:** I know Izzy wants to jump on a call next week to talk further.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm Always happy to jump on another call, work through things with Grant.
**Jon Kluger:** We're looking to partner with large organizations like yourselves so that we can actually build tools and cater the technology to your exact use cases.
**Jon Kluger:** So if it's a boiling down to costs and stuff like that, Alex and myself are very reasonable.
**Jon Kluger:** We already feel, feel that we have a very reasonable price.
**Jon Kluger:** But if it comes down to nickels and dimes, we're not going to count those we care about dollar signs.

**Chris Missling:** Yeah, I totally get it and thank you.
**Chris Missling:** I just gotta figure out all the things that he's paying for already, you know, so this is something a little bit different than I know that we're using on my side of the commercial side, you know, but we're, we're already paying for three different services on the commercial side that kind of help us data mine information leads for us.
**Chris Missling:** But this is a little bit different, it's a little bit unique where, where, where I can see the value of finding a different pool of potential leads.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.

**Chris Missling:** But I gotta kind of, I, I gotta kind of have this conversation with him and then I'm gonna have to share this with some of my other senior commercial agents just to see if this is something that they're going to, you know, utilize and adapt to what they're doing right now for how we data mine.
**Chris Missling:** So I'm going to take this reporting and share it with them and try to get some of their feedback as well.
**Chris Missling:** So if it's something that we're going to pay for, I want to make sure that my agents are going to use this 100%.

**Jon Kluger:** And something, something as well is you have the ability for each license to plug into multiple meta accounts.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say your agent has a personal Instagram where they're acting like an influencer and they're going and making videos and they're going and doing all of that.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a great way to Gartner.
**Jon Kluger:** I have a friend who's a real estate agent in New York.
**Jon Kluger:** Half of her leads comes from DMS on Instagram that says I follow your stuff, I don't need to sell my house or I need to find an office space, I need to do anything.
**Jon Kluger:** So if anyone has one of those and they have their business, they can plug into both.
**Jon Kluger:** And you could theoretically feed the same intent list or a different intent list to the same audience where one is getting a message from the business and the other is getting a message from their favorite real estate influencer.
**Jon Kluger:** So it can actually kind of expand that out because also I mean, if someone.
**Jon Kluger:** I joke internally, I say we could use this tool to make influencers better, because at the end of the day, they're.
**Jon Kluger:** They're making content for a specific audience.
**Jon Kluger:** Right.
**Jon Kluger:** So wouldn't it make more sense to target that audience with your content to get them to follow you?
**Jon Kluger:** So there's a.
**Jon Kluger:** You're on mute.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry.

**Chris Missling:** So, okay, so with that being said right there, like our team, we're pretty big on Facebook.
**Chris Missling:** We have a pretty big following.
**Chris Missling:** We have a lot of views right now.
**Chris Missling:** So you're telling me that what you have, we could integrate that with our Facebook business page and our Facebook accounts and expand on that and.

**Jon Kluger:** And.

**Chris Missling:** And pull data from that?
**Chris Missling:** Because that's our biggest social media platform that we really get.
**Chris Missling:** We get a lot of views.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** If you are.
**Jon Kluger:** You can literally push that.
**Jon Kluger:** Push this over and you can say anyone in this region that's not following us right now, we want to target with this to then either A, have them click, or B, maybe the goal is to have them follow the page.
**Jon Kluger:** What the type.
**Jon Kluger:** What the goal of your campaign is, is up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to push content that's entertaining to then get more views and more clicks and more follows, go for it.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to do content that is focused on getting people to click and apply to view or tour a place, it's all kind of.
**Jon Kluger:** It's all based on the type of creative that you use.
**Jon Kluger:** So just think about this as like people that like real estate or they like certain types of interior design.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have a video that's like, hey, here's the best ways to spruce up your new apartment, and it's literally a video about interior design and decorating.
**Jon Kluger:** You can pull an intent list of people who are interested in that in your specific area, create a piece of content, roll it out.
**Jon Kluger:** As long as the goal isn't necessarily to generate conversions, if you're distributing content that you want to sponsor or pay to promote just to get traction and following, Easy peasy.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Gentlemen, I don't mean to interrupt.

**Jon Kluger:** I do have to jump and train.

**Alex Ciereszko:** One of our associates.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's been great meeting with you guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm gonna let John take care of the rest.

**Chris Missling:** Okay, thank you.

**Jon Kluger:** Thanks for jumping in, Alex.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Bye, guys.

**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** So in terms of next steps, you'll get an email from Firefly AI Chris.
**Jon Kluger:** If you don't get it for any reason, just email me.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm on the invite.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm johntargetiq.com super duper easy, Izzy.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll see you Tomorrow.
**Jon Kluger:** But you can text me, we can arrange another time for us to connect.
**Jon Kluger:** Chris, if there's any other resources you need beyond this, I know I do.
**Jon Kluger:** Break down pricing in this call and give it a little more explanation.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me know.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm here, I'm available.
**Jon Kluger:** What I can tell you right now is we have numerous partners in the direct to consumer rental and real estate space, but we don't see people smart enough to use this in the commercial.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I can say is if you become the first who's doing targeted commercial, you can even go and do LinkedIn ads.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, we don't have that integration right now.
**Jon Kluger:** I have to confirm it will be on v2, but you could take the intent data in the LinkedIn contacts and literally target them with ads.
**Jon Kluger:** So the limitation is not just to meta, it's not just to Google, it's anywhere that you can run ads intent data to be leveraged.
**Jon Kluger:** Because essentially what you're doing is you're providing the matching link, which would be the LinkedIn URL versus on Facebook, it's the SHA256 and you can literally target on those channels.

**Israel Garavito:** John.
**Israel Garavito:** So I understand this correctly because this is way beyond my skill set, dude.
**Israel Garavito:** And I just want to keep it like in simple terms for this guy.
**Israel Garavito:** For me, when you talk about pixels, that means like we're putting something.

**Jon Kluger:** It's a data capture.
**Jon Kluger:** It's a piece of code that lives on a website that captures the data of someone that comes in.

**Israel Garavito:** So if somebody's looking to invest in Roars companies Web Roars company's multifamily website, I can capture that and reach out to them.

**Jon Kluger:** That will be released in V2.
**Jon Kluger:** It will have an additional cost.

**Israel Garavito:** But that's what you're saying, Correct?

**Jon Kluger:** We will have that.

**Israel Garavito:** Somebody wants to sell their building and they're looking for a broker and they click on market marks, Mill Chap, multifamily brokerage page, contact page.
**Israel Garavito:** We could get that lead at the same time saying, hey, this guy just.

**Jon Kluger:** Visited that guy, hits enter and he provides all his personal information and hits go.
**Jon Kluger:** They're going to have all of his personal information and all of that.
**Jon Kluger:** What we're able to collect may vary person to person, but yes, we'll be able to identify them at a 40 to 70% rate.

**Israel Garavito:** Wow.

**Jon Kluger:** Depending on the cookies on the website.
