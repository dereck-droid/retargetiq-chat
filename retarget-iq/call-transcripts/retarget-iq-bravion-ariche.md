## Transcript

**Jon Kluger:** I don't know.
**Jon Kluger:** Sound choppy.

**bravion ariche:** How do I sound?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, the Firefly AI will send you an email after this call with a link too, so you can access the recording and the transcript.

**bravion ariche:** No, no, I'm just saying you sound choppy.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, I sound choppy?

**bravion ariche:** Yeah, like, I don't know if it's.

**Jon Kluger:** Let me see.
**Jon Kluger:** Hold on.

**bravion ariche:** Can you hear me?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, you sound normal.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, hold on.

**Jon Kluger:** Let me take.
**Jon Kluger:** You're on mute.
**Jon Kluger:** You're on mute now.
**Jon Kluger:** Now you're off mute.
**Jon Kluger:** Can.
**Jon Kluger:** Am I choppy?

**bravion ariche:** It's a lot better, but this is fine.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, that's strange.
**Jon Kluger:** I need to figure out what's going on.
**Jon Kluger:** My roommate just texted me that the Internet, one of the.
**Jon Kluger:** I have a sub router and a regular router and he said the other router is acting up, so I might have to set that one, reset that one after this.

**bravion ariche:** The audio, like, it just.
**bravion ariche:** It's just a little statue behind, but it's okay.
**bravion ariche:** I can hear you fine.

**Jon Kluger:** Cool.
**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, I appreciate you taking the time today.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm glad we can reconnect.
**Jon Kluger:** We can go through a couple examples.
**Jon Kluger:** I know you sent over a few via email.
**Jon Kluger:** What I was just trying to highlight, just to clarify via email, was we have the ability to do personal injury or like auto accident for terms.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now, V2 launches in less than.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, in two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** V2, when it goes live, you can put any keyword intent in whatsoever.
**Jon Kluger:** So we have a list of 40,000.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now we're limited to, but then we're updating the platform to include free form text capabilities as well.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that.

**bravion ariche:** To include what again?

**Jon Kluger:** Free form.
**Jon Kluger:** So just open text box.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Free form.

**bravion ariche:** Gotcha.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, so the reason I mentioned that is right now we have the.
**Jon Kluger:** The offer is if you lock in at V1 prices, you are grandfathered in to V2.
**Jon Kluger:** I can confirm on a month to month basis per license, we're seeing at least a $250 increase from V1 to V2.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you are able to move forward before February 6th, I highly recommend it because it's going to save you a lot more money because base, base price right now for a quarterback is $500.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going up to 750 come February.
**Jon Kluger:** February 7th.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, so wait, so it starts on the 7th or the 15th.

**Jon Kluger:** So V2 launches on the 15th, but we're updating our pricing in preparation of V2 going live because we don't want it to be like the day that V2 goes live, the price goes up and everyone goes, whoa.
**Jon Kluger:** We want to be able to introduce the price beforehand.
**Jon Kluger:** And then when V2 goes live, everything kind of makes sense.

**bravion ariche:** Gotcha.
**bravion ariche:** Okay, so, so just, just to refresh my memory because now I, I can take notes and I'm kind of more locked and I wasn't not heading to an appointment.
**bravion ariche:** So whenever you're saying the difference in the data between you and like Apollo and, and Audience Lab and List Kit, what was the big differentiating factor?
**bravion ariche:** It's totally about to write it all down.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, it's the core data set that we leverage.
**Jon Kluger:** So we are one of less than five data providers in the world that have a contract with a publicly traded data company that allows for us to essentially pass this data to you.
**Jon Kluger:** Every one of our competitors uses a different data source.
**Jon Kluger:** We have this confirmed that essentially if, if there's a hierarchy in terms of data quality and all of that, our data set sits here.
**Jon Kluger:** There sits down here.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, so yours is, is from a publicly traded company.
**bravion ariche:** You're only one of the five companies have access to it.
**bravion ariche:** What, what is the.
**bravion ariche:** I guess the data is just as good as you is as from where.

**Jon Kluger:** You'Re pulling it from.

**bravion ariche:** So what makes yours like you're pulling from a better source or what?

**Jon Kluger:** Because yeah, it's a significantly better source that's leveraged by every Fortune 100 company in the country.
**Jon Kluger:** So not only that, we take that door for the core data set and imagine it's a lake sitting at the bottom of a waterfall.
**Jon Kluger:** We take 200 other data sets in waterfall enriched to fill up the lake for any gaps in terms of the data that we have and to be able to match to additional intent sources as well.

**bravion ariche:** Gotcha.
**bravion ariche:** So you're, so you're able to add more data into the information.
**bravion ariche:** Okay, and then so what, what are like the data points that you guys will be pulling or like have from.
**bravion ariche:** From a pool, like for example.

**Jon Kluger:** So each contact will have all of these data points.
**Jon Kluger:** So you'll be able to know their, their, their contact information, their address, their financials, company they worked at, contact information, device id, IP address.
**Jon Kluger:** The behaviors we don't export because this is a limited one, but for some of them, it's, it's hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of lines where you're essentially creating a mega file.
**Jon Kluger:** And then you even can see who owns the vehicle, what vehicles they own, and what homes they own.
**Jon Kluger:** If you are an intent list.
**Jon Kluger:** An intent list that was just our visitor information with the Super Pixel being able to capture website Visitors.
**Jon Kluger:** If you look at an intent list export, you'll see the SHA256 which is crucial for any targeting on Meta.

**bravion ariche:** Hold on one second.
**bravion ariche:** You kind of got choppy.
**bravion ariche:** Say the last part again.

**Jon Kluger:** It's the SHA256 code, which is the unique identifier leveraged by Meta, where Meta has been building a profile on every single one of their consumers for the last however long you've had a Meta account.
**Jon Kluger:** So matching it to the SHA256 means you're able to properly target them on Meta, be it Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, what have you.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, so that code tells you like what, like what their intent is or what is it?

**Jon Kluger:** It's literally them.
**Jon Kluger:** So like Stephanie Johnson, we can match to her exact Facebook or Instagram profile.

**bravion ariche:** Gotcha.
**bravion ariche:** Okay, I see.
**bravion ariche:** So.
**bravion ariche:** So this is, this is Meta's profile corresponding with the data.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct?

**bravion ariche:** Gotcha.

**Jon Kluger:** So this is why we're able to cut.
**Jon Kluger:** Our clients are able to cut their costs for ads in half and double their conversion because it's actually targeting the right person rather than just guessing who is who.
**Jon Kluger:** So by having as a J256, we can confidently say we are getting in front of the right person with the intent that they're showing.

**bravion ariche:** Well, can you go back to that last screen you're on that show?
**bravion ariche:** The.
**bravion ariche:** It was like, it was in the right hand side.
**bravion ariche:** It just showed like, I don't know, name.

**Jon Kluger:** So this is what we're able to pull using our Super Pixel for anyone that lands on a website.

**bravion ariche:** So now that is, that's, that's like an addition to what I looked at a while ago.
**bravion ariche:** Or.

**Jon Kluger:** No, this is, this is included.
**Jon Kluger:** So we give you five Super Pixels with every account, every license.
**Jon Kluger:** So you say five clients and they each have a website.
**Jon Kluger:** You put this pixel on the website and what it's able to do is it's able to capture people who haven't filled out information.
**Jon Kluger:** So depending on the cookie permissions of the website, when someone lands, we're able to capture who they are at a 40 to 70% rate, depending on if they are accepting cookies or not.
**Jon Kluger:** So they could even just land on the page, click on one thing, and then close the tab and we have a very high likelihood chance of being able to say that was so and so.

**bravion ariche:** Right, but that's from.
**bravion ariche:** That's the people that went on the sites that you Talked.
**bravion ariche:** The Fortune 100 sites you're talking about.

**Jon Kluger:** No, no, no.
**Jon Kluger:** This is any website, your website.
**Jon Kluger:** Like if you put a Super Pixel on your website, you can capture the post to your website.
**Jon Kluger:** Right?

**bravion ariche:** Right.
**bravion ariche:** I'm just saying.
**bravion ariche:** But that's my traffic.
**bravion ariche:** But I'm just saying anyone else on.

**Jon Kluger:** A different website, if there's other people, we build an audience based off of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** What I'm saying is, is this feature is included where you can have 5 pixels on 5 different websites for your clients.
**Jon Kluger:** And say, I can identify everybody that's coming to the website, where they're coming from and what they look like.
**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**bravion ariche:** Right.
**bravion ariche:** But I just want to clarify because one, one is a site that I pick are my sites, but the other I'm talking about is just general data.

**Jon Kluger:** That's not the general data that we then.
**Jon Kluger:** So like we identified Carlene here right now.
**Jon Kluger:** We can scroll over and see more information on Carlene.
**Jon Kluger:** This information is provided from our core data sets.
**Jon Kluger:** This isn't magically.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not able to just like magically pull it from her visit.
**Jon Kluger:** We're able to match her based off of either her IP or her device ID and then say so and so visited your website.
**Jon Kluger:** If you know them, if they.
**Jon Kluger:** If it feeds into your CRM, your CRM could then get alert you that, hey, one of your people that you've been outreaching to is on the website.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, someone is reacting to the ad.
**Jon Kluger:** They're now on the website and this is without them filling out a form.
**Jon Kluger:** So I always say, like, there's so many people that offer services where you can put in all your information for a quote, and then half the time they end up abandoning that and they don't put in their final contact information.
**Jon Kluger:** This still allows for you to capture.
**Jon Kluger:** This is added what you need.
**Jon Kluger:** What I'm talking about with the big data set is when we create audiences based off of intent, that's where the core data is looking at the consumer behavior across the entire Internet.
**Jon Kluger:** So I'm just talking.
**Jon Kluger:** The super pixel just says, hey, Ray Vaughan came to the website.
**Jon Kluger:** That's it.
**Jon Kluger:** That's it.
**Jon Kluger:** And then the rest of the data fills in the gaps of Ray Vaughan's email.
**Jon Kluger:** Is this because we know it's radion?
**Jon Kluger:** And then that's just what the super pixel provides.
**Jon Kluger:** The audience builder is where we go in and we go and we type solar panels.
**Jon Kluger:** We select 14 days, we add a rule.
**Jon Kluger:** What state do you want this in?

**bravion ariche:** California.

**Jon Kluger:** State will be in.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll choose California.
**Jon Kluger:** Then we're going to add that they're a homeowner.
**Jon Kluger:** We hit build audience.
**Jon Kluger:** What this is going to do is this taps into all of Those data sets that we have and it says based off of your ability to look at consumer behaviors and our thresholds for what we define as intent, which is someone doing research or working on websites or doing something as it relates to solar, then they're identified as having intent.
**Jon Kluger:** A low level intent, I say is like a B.
**Jon Kluger:** It's still good.
**Jon Kluger:** You still want to target them.
**Jon Kluger:** It's a B.
**Jon Kluger:** A medium level is like an A where you're like, yeah, like that's good.
**Jon Kluger:** And then a high level is an A plus where you're like, hell yeah, like we're going to knock this out.
**Jon Kluger:** This is exactly who I want.
**Jon Kluger:** That's how I kind of look at ranking.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see is in California, homeowners that have looked up and shown in 10 to solar in the last 14 days is about 30,233.
**Jon Kluger:** What you would do is hit download all, you would say cali solar panel.

**bravion ariche:** These people have like typed in solar panels or what did they do exactly.

**Jon Kluger:** With our category based off of those pre built intent categories, each word.
**Jon Kluger:** So solar panel has tons of different iterations off of it that eat up into a single kind of phrase.
**Jon Kluger:** Because what we didn't want is for people in this version.
**Jon Kluger:** We were asked to add this, so we're going to add it.
**Jon Kluger:** But our fear is, is people are just going to sit there and think of as many intent categories as they can think of without considering that you only want to put in the ones that are actually highly relevant to your message.
**Jon Kluger:** So like people were putting in, let's say it's roofing, broken copper roof.
**Jon Kluger:** Now all of a sudden you're trying to target broken copper roof.
**Jon Kluger:** But broken copper might end up as a possible intent because you're constantly looking up things.
**Jon Kluger:** And if someone's looking up broken copper or broken roof or copper roof, you want to focus on that key phrase more than the deviations off of the phrase.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I always try to explain to people is instead of being ultra specific and very nuanced, try to think of how someone would google something and the words and think about how I hate to say it, think about how an idiot would do it.
**Jon Kluger:** That's true.
**Jon Kluger:** That's kind of how I explain to people.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm like, if I don't know something, I trust Google.
**Jon Kluger:** So like I talked to a company who works with a professional baseball players bourbon line.
**Jon Kluger:** And I said, well, how do we think people are going to actually search this?
**Jon Kluger:** And I said, probably by the team's name plus bourbon if they don't remember what it's called or by the player's name and the word bourbon.
**Jon Kluger:** But if you search just the player's name, for instance, what you're going to run into is every fan girl who wants to pull up a photo of him because she thinks she's hot.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's not what you want for intent, because it's unlikely that they're going to be the ones buying his bourbon.
**Jon Kluger:** Right, so once we find your software.

**bravion ariche:** So your, your software filters that out or how does it navigate to know.

**Jon Kluger:** Which one to wear not to Right now?
**Jon Kluger:** By selecting it based off of our pre built intent categories.
**Jon Kluger:** Yes.
**Jon Kluger:** We help kind of mitigate some of the error possibility v2 will release essentially two things.
**Jon Kluger:** One, you'll be able to write in free form, write whatever you want for the intent category.
**Jon Kluger:** Two, we'll also have an audience builder for you.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're actually going to have AI where you can actually communicate with the AI, and the AI will put together an intent category for you that makes sense based off of your need.
**Jon Kluger:** Then that will be able to communicate best with the internal systems and match it to the right picture, essentially.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, but so, so, so just so I'm clear, these people, they were on some site or some search engine or something and they were typing in solar panels or.

**Jon Kluger:** Or solar panel for sale.
**Jon Kluger:** Solar power.
**Jon Kluger:** Solar.
**Jon Kluger:** Solar panels is looked at as the bigger picture of someone who has the intent for solar because they're essentially buying the solar panels while leasing them.
**Jon Kluger:** However they broker the deals nowadays, that allows for them to essentially be matched to that.
**Jon Kluger:** Like if someone was looking for solar sales, that's different because now they're looking for a job, not necessarily solar for sale, if that makes sense.

**bravion ariche:** Right, so maybe like solar install or so like.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we had that as an option that was on there.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**bravion ariche:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** So like, one thing to show you as well.
**Jon Kluger:** You can schedule this to repeat every day, every week, every month, however often you want.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you want to constantly be updating this list every single day, you can easily do that.
**Jon Kluger:** And it will automatically do that.
**Jon Kluger:** If I set Save now, you'll see it as a saved query.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can just go back and that will automatically refresh with that.
**Jon Kluger:** You can schedule it to even send to your ad accounts every single day, every week, however often you want.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that is if you find an intent list that works well, you want to constantly refresh it because the people that showed intent a month ago are different than the ones that are showing it this week.
**Jon Kluger:** So by having it automatically scheduled to refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say it's for you or a client, whomever it is.
**Jon Kluger:** All you have to do is find a single intent list that has the right targeting for you, create a creative that is simple and speaks to that audience, and then all you have to do is refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** Because what's going to happen is Meta's AI Andromeda is going to learn from every single click and every single conversion and it looks for people that share a commonality within your list that goes on to meadows level.
**Jon Kluger:** So Meta has been building a profile on me for 15 years.
**Jon Kluger:** It knows who I follow, it knows what I say, it knows what I do, it knows where I am.
**Jon Kluger:** So it looks for a commonality between me and anyone else on that list who also has converted then that trait.
**Jon Kluger:** They then take and find everyone else on the list who shares that trait and sends them the ad up front.
**Jon Kluger:** So the whole idea is it's leveraging their data that knows about my behaviors and what I might have in common with you.
**Jon Kluger:** And if we share a common trait and they pick up on a statistical significance where maybe being a dog lover makes me buy, I don't know, more outdoor gear.
**Jon Kluger:** And that isn't necessarily.
**Jon Kluger:** You're not targeting people with the intent of outdoor gear, you're targeting people on the intent of dog toys, let's say.
**Jon Kluger:** And it just so happens that the list of people that have all have intent for dog toys on our data set have a commonality in the high converting ones that they all like to hike.
**Jon Kluger:** So Meta is just going to say we need to target more of the people from this list that like to hike because it's going to be more likely to convert.
**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**bravion ariche:** So now that that feature you're talking about, that's something that's Meta.
**bravion ariche:** Meta is doing.
**bravion ariche:** But your, your software is going to tap into that and pull from that data point.

**Jon Kluger:** Yes, because what happens is if we use the same audience in the same campaign and you just refresh for the same levels of intent every time new people get added, Meta's looking for those commonalities on their end of that list.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's what Andromeda, the AI system does, is it analyzes their data on everyone and says what can we match all these people up on and take advantage of?
**Jon Kluger:** That would be statistically significant.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, and then so is that, that's part of the new feature that's going to be a V2 or the AI.

**Jon Kluger:** Is going to be available currently.
**Jon Kluger:** What I mean it as this is 100% available currently.
**Jon Kluger:** What I mean by that is you just push it over to Andromeda and Andromeda does it for you.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what it's designed for.
**Jon Kluger:** Just like here, I'll send you over a video that explains it.

**bravion ariche:** So once you get.
**bravion ariche:** Well, so once you export the list.
**bravion ariche:** Once you get the list exported to Andromeda, and then they'll spit out the results.

**Jon Kluger:** What they're able to do once they have it, and this is just one of them.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me see if this guy's any good.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, if you watch this, it will explain Andromeda a little bit more.
**Jon Kluger:** But what I'm.
**Jon Kluger:** What I'm trying to explain is, like, we find the people whose behavior across the Internet shows they want to buy something.
**Jon Kluger:** All that's happening is you're now creating an ad campaign for our list.
**Jon Kluger:** Right.
**Jon Kluger:** One that we just pulled up, let's pretend.
**Jon Kluger:** And we're seeing for solar.
**Jon Kluger:** What we then do is we push it over to Meta and their AI starts running ads.
**Jon Kluger:** When people start converting, they look at all of the conversions and they say, what do we have in common on their data?
**Jon Kluger:** Then what they do is look at the rest of the audience that you gave them and say, I'm going to serve ads to those people that share that common characteristic first.
**Jon Kluger:** Then when you add more later, after the campaign's already started, it does the same analysis for the first for the new people, and stops running ads to the old ones that are no longer on that list to avoid wasting ad spend on people that don't have intent anymore.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, so that's just a feature where you're tying into Gotcha.
**bravion ariche:** Because some.
**bravion ariche:** Because my partner I work with out of.
**bravion ariche:** Out of Florida.
**bravion ariche:** I mean, out of California, you know, I mean, this list, they might call the door knock it or whatever.
**bravion ariche:** So they have different ways of attacking, you know, the people.
**bravion ariche:** I was just curious about what you're meaning by that, but yeah.
**bravion ariche:** Okay, so go ahead.

**Jon Kluger:** So once you schedule it, what you're able to do is you can literally sit back and relax and not have to do anything ever again.
**Jon Kluger:** Because if you find an audience that fits, you run the intent target and you run the campaign with a good creative, it should continuously perform because you're adding fresh intent while continuously giving new targets.
**Jon Kluger:** So what we always recommend is simple ad creatives just like the one you clicked on.
**Jon Kluger:** It literally was like, are you looking at Audience Lab or do you use audience Lab?
**Jon Kluger:** We are cheaper and we have better data.
**Jon Kluger:** We literally have ads that Are that simple.

**bravion ariche:** Right.

**Jon Kluger:** That's how simple you need to be.
**Jon Kluger:** Then from there we have integrations.

**bravion ariche:** Quick question, out of curiosity.
**bravion ariche:** Did you, did you.
**bravion ariche:** Were you able to see that I had reached out to audience lab.

**Jon Kluger:** We were able to see that you had intent and you had been researching audience lab and you had been doing things across the Internet.
**Jon Kluger:** That relates to audience lab.
**Jon Kluger:** Yes.

**bravion ariche:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** You were, you were one of our intent audiences that we built and we ran meta ads on and Andromeda continuously improved it.
**Jon Kluger:** And it does every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** Every time we turn on our ads, we spend a hundred bucks a day.
**Jon Kluger:** We turn on our ads.
**Jon Kluger:** We have 15 booked meetings.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, because it's the targeting and because Facebook probably looks at do these people also have a business account?
**Jon Kluger:** For instance, they look at do these people have a Google or do these people have a meta ads account and they probably go, oh, that's a good target.
**Jon Kluger:** Because it's someone who has a commonality between all of our conversions is probably someone also has a Google meta ads account account.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's how.
**Jon Kluger:** That's just one characteristic that for instance, they have plenty of different tags, different characteristics, different filters.
**Jon Kluger:** But instead of you trying to build out everything, you give them the list of the high intent people and it does it all for you where it picks up on whatever demographic specific demographic is the top performing.
**Jon Kluger:** Because we could filter it down to just men, certain age, certain income, everything that you want to be granular.
**Jon Kluger:** But unless we have the statistics behind it to say that's your true target, you might as well take the larger list and let meta tell you these are the actual people converting to your ads.
**Jon Kluger:** Let us focus on those.
**Jon Kluger:** So with all these additional integrations, you're able to manage multiple meta accounts.
**Jon Kluger:** As of now, we're only able to connect directly into a single CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** And V1, in V2, you'll be able to connect into multiple CRM so you could plug directly into your client CRMs.
**Jon Kluger:** Beyond the first integration, there will be an additional 50 to 100 to $100.
**Jon Kluger:** We're finalizing that price for each additional instance.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason we did that is instead of you having to buy a whole new license to work with a different client, we want you to have a single interface that's easy for you to use and we just have to pay overhead to build in another integration.
**Jon Kluger:** So I'm all about trying to make it as a la carte as possible where if you want to add additional integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** Heck yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to just download CSVs and upload them to your clients to avoid that.
**Jon Kluger:** Go for it.
**Jon Kluger:** It's totally up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** We just have to essentially prescribe to you exactly what you need rather than giving you a giant bill and telling you, hey, these are all the features you have.
**Jon Kluger:** Regardless.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's 500 bucks with unlimited audiences, unlimited lead lists, private, those megapixel super pixels.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me, unlimited website visitors.
**Jon Kluger:** You get one integration per CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** So it could be one HubSpot, one Go High level, one Salesforce if you wanted to, and unlimited meta connections.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's because we view that as the perfect starting pack for someone that wants to get going.
**Jon Kluger:** And if they have more than one client that they want to connect with, instead of having to buy an additional license, they can just have an additional connection.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, so I understand what you're saying from a high level, obviously once I get in the weeds of it, it'll make more sense with, you know, everything that you're saying.
**bravion ariche:** So whenever you talk about.
**bravion ariche:** So I have, I have a couple of things that just to kind of.

**Jon Kluger:** Give you be more specific.

**bravion ariche:** So before I go back, before I get the two sidetracked.
**bravion ariche:** So the 30,233, those were people that were in California in the past couple of weeks that did something with solar panels.

**Jon Kluger:** So these are all, these are people that have shown intent.
**Jon Kluger:** So yes, you can say something, but it's really like the researching solar panel tax write off solar panel benefits, solar panel, whatever it might be.

**bravion ariche:** Gotcha.
**bravion ariche:** And then so, so now Priscilla, the first one, Ginger, it's like a lot of numbers for her.

**Jon Kluger:** So, so realistically, transparently, we recommend to target these, these clients.
**Jon Kluger:** We have email validation coming in v2, so you can do an email outreach.
**Jon Kluger:** But in terms of phone here, the only one that I typically recommend trying is mobile.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is we have a repository of over 3 billion phone numbers that have been linked to people.
**Jon Kluger:** So we, we allow those to still be stone.
**Jon Kluger:** But it would be next to impossible for us to sit here and call Ginger 20 times a day until she picks up on every single one of these or if she doesn't omitting them because there's too many external factors like I don't answer cold calls, period.
**Jon Kluger:** If I see a number I don't recognize, I don't answer.
**Jon Kluger:** That doesn't mean it's not my phone number, it just means I don't answer.
**Jon Kluger:** So in terms of phone number validation, it's very difficult for us to say so, but what I can say is the mobile number listed is usually the one that we're the most confident in.

**bravion ariche:** Gotcha.
**bravion ariche:** So her name, her email address, her phone number, her address, city state, her age range.
**bravion ariche:** And then some of them say homeowner, some of them don't has their income.

**Jon Kluger:** As their position, if they have a LinkedIn available.
**Jon Kluger:** Some people, like someone who's 65 years or older, might not have a LinkedIn.
**Jon Kluger:** So like there won't always be the LinkedIn.
**Jon Kluger:** And you can see all the different types of, excuse me, roles they have and how much money they're even making.

**bravion ariche:** Gotcha.
**bravion ariche:** So then you would take this data, you would export it over to, I guess in Excel and then send it over to Meta.

**Jon Kluger:** No.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I was trying to show before is you can send it to Meadow from here directly.

**bravion ariche:** Got you to my.

**Jon Kluger:** To the Meta account, to the meta campaign.
**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**bravion ariche:** And then.
**bravion ariche:** So then they will run as these 30,000 people.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.
**Jon Kluger:** And you are able to do that.
**Jon Kluger:** And then if this is the audience you focus on, Instead of throwing 10 creatives at it, you throw one creative that talks purely to your.
**Jon Kluger:** Your value prop.
**Jon Kluger:** And the reason for that is it.
**Jon Kluger:** It reduces the amount of variables.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have 10 different creatives that have 10 different messages, it becomes that.
**Jon Kluger:** Now Andromeda has to test those 10 creatives across everything.
**Jon Kluger:** So you're paying 10 times more and it might not be as relevant.
**Jon Kluger:** And you're also essentially not simplifying it.
**Jon Kluger:** I always joke with people, when are you on Instagram or Facebook, on your phone, you're on the toilet or you're in front of the tv?
**Jon Kluger:** The simpler the message, the more likely it is someone clicks to learn more because they're showing intent that they're already researching into solar panels.
**Jon Kluger:** Now you, you put an ad up that says, want a free quote on solar that is going to make people click on that?
**Jon Kluger:** Because they're already thinking about that and you're hitting them as they're still researching and thinking and highly interested.

**bravion ariche:** Gotcha.
**bravion ariche:** And then.
**bravion ariche:** So you can run this every day.
**bravion ariche:** So this one was.
**bravion ariche:** Was Cali.
**bravion ariche:** But if I want to do, you know, a city specific or whatever.
**bravion ariche:** Same thing.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.
**Jon Kluger:** You just put the city name.

**bravion ariche:** Gotcha.

**Jon Kluger:** It's super easy.
**Jon Kluger:** And if you don't have a creative that's super simple that you need, I.

**bravion ariche:** Mean.

**Jon Kluger:** Give me a.
**Jon Kluger:** Generate.
**Jon Kluger:** A medic.
**Jon Kluger:** Please take into consideration the best practices for.
**Jon Kluger:** And drama.
**Jon Kluger:** Duh.
**Jon Kluger:** And I can't spell.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me, did I misspell it?
**Jon Kluger:** You can see how I spell it, right?
**Jon Kluger:** I don't want to misspell it.
**Jon Kluger:** Best Practices for Andromeda selling solar panel.
**Jon Kluger:** Solar power or.
**Jon Kluger:** Solar.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, solar.
**Jon Kluger:** In where?
**Jon Kluger:** What city?

**bravion ariche:** Los Angeles.

**Jon Kluger:** So when you don't have a simple creative to test, what you can always do, I mean, this is.
**Jon Kluger:** ChatGPT is next to nothing in terms of cost.
**Jon Kluger:** But I always say, go and find a prompt.
**Jon Kluger:** There's hundreds of thousands of prompt and template libraries out there where people do this, where they literally find companies, reach out to them, make their ads on meta AI, excuse me, and then they just say, all I need is a meta budget.
**Jon Kluger:** They pull an intent list and they just target and run it and get paid per lead.
**Jon Kluger:** There's numerous customers just like that, just to be transparent.
**Jon Kluger:** So being able to just go in there and serve it up, super duper simple.
**Jon Kluger:** It's created.
**Jon Kluger:** I just used AI to create that just now.
**Jon Kluger:** You would put that ad up and distribute it to the people on that intent list.
**Jon Kluger:** And what that's going to allow for you to do is people who already showing intent on solar in that area will see an ad that's highly relevant to them.
**Jon Kluger:** Grow solar in Los Angeles.
**Jon Kluger:** And you're able to make the message super duper simple.
**Jon Kluger:** You're more likely to get them to convert because they already have been showing intent for this category.
**Jon Kluger:** It's like the people that go, oh my God, how did they know I needed this?
**Jon Kluger:** You showed intent now, we just targeted you.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, in terms of pricing, as I mentioned before, it's super, super simple.
**Jon Kluger:** We're doing $500 a month promotion right now, paid quarterly.
**Jon Kluger:** If you pay before February 6th, you're locked in at V1 prices for V2 and forever.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I mean by that is it's very likely that each of our, each of our offerings there are going to increase in price by $250 a month.
**Jon Kluger:** So by locking in B1 prices, you're saying essentially a third of what it will be in three weeks, two weeks, and you're grandfathered in at the V1 price.
**Jon Kluger:** So you get V2 for the price of V1 for as long as you're a paying customer.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, so, so what's these prices?
**bravion ariche:** 75504 17.

**Jon Kluger:** So 750 is if you pay on a month to month, which doesn't lock you in for pricing.
**Jon Kluger:** If you do quarterly or annual, you're locked in at that monthly cost for the life of your partnership with us.
**Jon Kluger:** The quarterly you just have to pay three months up front and then every three months you pay another 1500.
**Jon Kluger:** 1500.
**Jon Kluger:** 1500 for annual.
**Jon Kluger:** You would do a One time flat fee of $5,000 per month, per year.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me, Excuse me, sorry.

**bravion ariche:** So $1,500 would be quarterly.
**bravion ariche:** Okay.
**bravion ariche:** So whenever you pull this here.
**bravion ariche:** So yeah, so you were distinguishing.
**bravion ariche:** So your, your, your intent, your data is higher than all the other sources of data out there.
**bravion ariche:** It is 500amonth.

**Jon Kluger:** Now.
**Jon Kluger:** Unlimited audience building.
**Jon Kluger:** Unlimited audience building.
**Jon Kluger:** Unlimited lists.
**Jon Kluger:** You can have up to a million people per list.
**Jon Kluger:** It's purple.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's just because genuinely, you really shouldn't do more than a million.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, you really shouldn't even do a million because like, if you do a million, your list is not specific enough in my opinion.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**bravion ariche:** And then so now whenever you, you get set up, so any kind of marketing campaign or any type of email campaign, anything I do to, to target.

**Jon Kluger:** These clients, that's on me.

**bravion ariche:** So.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.
**Jon Kluger:** We're providing you the data showing you who's giving you intent.
**Jon Kluger:** It's basically someone's on the Internet waving a flag that says I want to buy.
**Jon Kluger:** Right.
**Jon Kluger:** It's just a matter of you getting in front of them.

**bravion ariche:** Okay.
**bravion ariche:** All right.
**bravion ariche:** And then so the new improvements in the V2 is going to be what exactly?

**Jon Kluger:** 10 more.
**Jon Kluger:** 10 plus more integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** The UI UX will be cleaner.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll be able to type any topic for intent.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll be able to have multiple.
**Jon Kluger:** Multiple topics for intent.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we'll have the audience builder which will help you pick those audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** If you need help and identify the intent topics for you additionally, have it written down.
**Jon Kluger:** One moment.
**Jon Kluger:** Stronger measurement and optimizations.
**Jon Kluger:** The analytics on website visitors and stuff like that will be deeper and more visually accessible.
**Jon Kluger:** Over here where we have this, the analytics here, where we look at the breakdown of the demographics, there'll be even more robust information per website and you'll have the ability to connect to multiple iterations of the same CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** So each of your customers has a go high level.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now we can't connect into each of them.
**Jon Kluger:** You would need a different license.
**Jon Kluger:** But come February 15th, for a small additional fee of either 50 or $100, we're finalizing that you'll be able to add, say unlimited go high level accounts.
**Jon Kluger:** You just have to connect them individually.

**bravion ariche:** So what were you saying yesterday about like being able to license it to other people?

**Jon Kluger:** That's the white label.
**Jon Kluger:** So what the white label does is for three, starting for $3,000 a month, you get 10 licenses branded to you.
**Jon Kluger:** These 10 licenses branded to you then can sell to your clients for whatever price you'd like.
**Jon Kluger:** What the website's going to list it as is $750 minimum for us.
**Jon Kluger:** So if we do some quick math, each license is going to cost you at most $400 if you do the month to month on the white label.
**Jon Kluger:** With that being said, a our public price listed will be 750 minimum.
**Jon Kluger:** What that means is you have a $350 margin per month.
**Jon Kluger:** If you sell it at 750, you could sell it at a thousand.
**Jon Kluger:** I have one client who sells, who sold this to one guy for 2,000.
**Jon Kluger:** Then it's just branded to you.
**Jon Kluger:** They have their own access.
**Jon Kluger:** They can choose if they want to use the tool, be involved in that process or you can still full manage it and fully handle it.
**Jon Kluger:** It just gives you the ability to essentially sell, sell them their own instance in the platform if they want one.
**Jon Kluger:** Otherwise you just manage everything for them.
**Jon Kluger:** They never need to get into it.
**Jon Kluger:** Then you just need to get an additional integration if you want to push it to their CRM.

**bravion ariche:** So licensing it, giving them access to it is one, the other one is just pushing it to their CRM.
**bravion ariche:** So I'm still paying my portion, I'm just pushing it out.
**bravion ariche:** They don't have direct access to the site.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.
**Jon Kluger:** Because you don't, you don't want them having direct access because what essentially a single license does is you have one instance here.
**Jon Kluger:** There's no, like I can switch between who has permissions here, who can do this.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you gave your client access to your single license because you had an integration with them, they could mess up and send a bunch of things to someone else's CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** They can mess up and send a long lead list to meta and run up one of your other clients.
**Jon Kluger:** Meta bills like it's very dangerous to give them access to your platform if you use a single license.
**Jon Kluger:** White label lets you just give them a holistically individual one.

**bravion ariche:** So once I, I do single license, then I can export it out to a CRM then from there.
**bravion ariche:** Yeah, and then I will send it to them.
**bravion ariche:** And then they would do their own sending it to meta or whatever.

**Jon Kluger:** If that's how you have it arranged.
**Jon Kluger:** Sure.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to do the meta ads for them as an added cost or an added service, it's your call.
**Jon Kluger:** It's totally up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** We have some people who sell lists, we have some people who do the ads for them and manage it all through one platform.
**Jon Kluger:** It's totally up to you.

**bravion ariche:** So I could, so if I did the ad part, I would get the list, do the creative Run the ads for them and then give them the leads, sell per lead or whatever.
**bravion ariche:** I agree to them.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**bravion ariche:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** All right.

**bravion ariche:** Lastly, let me just see because I was curious about how you would be able to find businesses that like didn't have health insurance or like.
**bravion ariche:** So I was curious about like what kind of searches would that be?
**bravion ariche:** Like people that look health.

**Jon Kluger:** So if we go into insurance, what we can find we have life insurance, loan insurance, title insurance, health insurance, you said.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**bravion ariche:** So corporations or businesses, they have W2 employees, they need health insurance or don't.

**Jon Kluger:** Have it, or even if they do.

**bravion ariche:** Have it, then I can.

**Jon Kluger:** So what we can't.
**Jon Kluger:** We can't look at it as XYZ business.
**Jon Kluger:** What we're looking at is the people within the business who have shown intent for health insurance.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, so this is only consumer.
**bravion ariche:** Consumer only.

**Jon Kluger:** It's not B to C looks at consumer and purchase.
**Jon Kluger:** B2B is looking at purchases on behalf of a business.
**Jon Kluger:** So health insurance on a B2B here is saying someone in this business who we've identified, they will come up on the list and the business information will be there too.
**Jon Kluger:** Is looking up health insurance in a business facet.
**Jon Kluger:** So they're looking up health insurance for business.
**Jon Kluger:** Health insurance something to do with business to business.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not versus intent.
**Jon Kluger:** B2C would be health insurance for me.
**Jon Kluger:** Health insurance for family health insurance for it's different in that regard.
**Jon Kluger:** But I can't, I can't tell you.
**Jon Kluger:** I know for a fact this company has health insurance or doesn't.

**bravion ariche:** Okay, so B2B.
**bravion ariche:** So B2B.
**bravion ariche:** Are you able to categorize it by employees, revenue or.

**Jon Kluger:** Where are you company size in and we can say how big do 50.

**bravion ariche:** To 100 is fine.

**Jon Kluger:** Specific area Texas do that.
**Jon Kluger:** I do have to go.
**Jon Kluger:** After we pull this one though, I will follow.
**Jon Kluger:** This is.

**bravion ariche:** This is my original reason for calling.
**bravion ariche:** So I'm just curious about what.
**bravion ariche:** So you type.
**bravion ariche:** You typed in this.
**bravion ariche:** These companies and health insurance.
**bravion ariche:** And this is what this is.

**Jon Kluger:** What's coming back category is a B2B for health insurance.
**Jon Kluger:** Which means someone is looking for health insurance in a B2B facet.
**Jon Kluger:** Doesn't mean that they're at work on their work computer is searching health insurance.
**Jon Kluger:** No, that would still be a B2C intent because it's personal health insurance.
**Jon Kluger:** This is more so oriented in the B2B front.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** 602.

**bravion ariche:** So all these people are in these company or I don't know what their.

**Jon Kluger:** Company is now we do.
**Jon Kluger:** All of these different companies were showing someone from them was showing intent for health insurance.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I'll do after this, you'll get a call recording from our conversation from Fireflies.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you need to reference back anything, feel free.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll send a follow up that includes a payment link.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll drop it in here too, just so you have it.
**Jon Kluger:** This is for the quarterly, so you can lock in at the price and then from there, if anything else comes up, if you have any more questions, feel free to email me and we can work things out.
**Jon Kluger:** Just to be transparent, that price does get raised on February 7, so we have to lock you in before next Friday.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, cool.
**Jon Kluger:** Ran, it's a pleasure.
**Jon Kluger:** I look forward to.

**bravion ariche:** Thanks.
**bravion ariche:** I appreciate it.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, anytime.
**Jon Kluger:** Hopefully we get to work together.

**bravion ariche:** Yeah, sounds good.

**Jon Kluger:** See ya.

**bravion ariche:** Thanks.
