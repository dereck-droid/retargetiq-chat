## Transcript

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Oh, no, no, Zen.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You gotta get the Mr. Vapor Blue Raspberry.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, okay.
**Jon Kluger:** I haven't heard of that brand.
**Jon Kluger:** There's so many.
**Jon Kluger:** Now.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Where do you live?

**Jon Kluger:** Where do you live at North Carolina.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** See if you've got a MIST or Wild Bills Tobacco.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** That's their own brand.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And these things are fantastic.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** I definitely love.
**Jon Kluger:** There's a brand.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, hell yeah.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Oh, yeah.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Here's my morning one.

**Jon Kluger:** Yep.
**Jon Kluger:** I've got my coffees over there.
**Jon Kluger:** It's actually pretty funny.
**Jon Kluger:** I.
**Jon Kluger:** So outside of this, I actually own vape vending machines inside of bars and music venues.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** So I just saw that on Facebook this morning.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So you.
**Jon Kluger:** No, no, I'm not that big.
**Jon Kluger:** I wish, but no, I'm.
**Jon Kluger:** I do it here in North Carolina.
**Jon Kluger:** It's actually really interesting because we're regulated now in the state that you can only sell vapes that are approved by the fda.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Right.

**Jon Kluger:** Which ironically, one of them is called the Inmate.
**Jon Kluger:** It's the one that they sell in prisons because, you know, they.
**Jon Kluger:** They ban cigarettes in prison.
**Jon Kluger:** So now they are beeping.
**Jon Kluger:** Fun fact.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** What's America come to?
**Jon Kluger:** I thought we used to like.
**Jon Kluger:** I thought the tradition was everyone in prison supposed to just be chain smoking.
**Jon Kluger:** But you know, the movies lie.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Right.

**Jon Kluger:** But when you.
**Jon Kluger:** When I looked into wholesale distribution for all of these pouches, there's like 1500 different pouches brands now.
**Jon Kluger:** Wow.
**Jon Kluger:** It's insanity.
**Jon Kluger:** The one that I've actually liked personally a lot, it's called Sesh.
**Jon Kluger:** S E S H. If you have.
**Jon Kluger:** Do you have sheets?
**Jon Kluger:** I'm guessing you're up in the Detroit area, is that correct?

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I'm in west Michigan.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** But I don't know if we only have any sheets over here.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It might be over by Detroit, but not here.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I like Sesh is it's.
**Jon Kluger:** It's food grade.
**Jon Kluger:** Everything in it is food grade, so it's super smooth.
**Jon Kluger:** The 6mg don't hit you up front because they're like.
**Jon Kluger:** This sounds weird, but they're.
**Jon Kluger:** The wet pouches.
**Jon Kluger:** They're not like.
**Jon Kluger:** So.
**Jon Kluger:** But they're not super dry.
**Jon Kluger:** Like a zen.
**Jon Kluger:** And really, really like those because they don't.
**Jon Kluger:** They don't cut up my gums.
**Jon Kluger:** That's the biggest issue I have with some of the other brands is they're a little bit aggressive.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Fiberglass.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm just like.
**Jon Kluger:** I had my days back when I was in college where I would throw in some actual chaos because I'm.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm in North Carolina, so I Can turn Southern real quick, don't you worry about.
**Jon Kluger:** But I used to do chaw, and everyone was like, fiberglass, fiberglass.
**Jon Kluger:** And I never believed them.
**Jon Kluger:** And then I was like, damn, my gums are torn up.
**Jon Kluger:** So now I'm just kind of.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Kodiak was the worst.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Kodiak.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, yeah, it was Kodiak and Grizz.
**Jon Kluger:** Those are the two.
**Jon Kluger:** Grizz Wintergreen.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** See, I did.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I did Kodiak all through high school.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I used to do upper deckers because.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So you wouldn't get caught.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And then I smoked for about 25 years.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Quit, went to vapes, and I. I kind of transitioned back to chewing again.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I went to Copenhagen.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Long cut Wintergreen.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I got.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I got tired of carrying around a freaking spitter.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And I saw one of my.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** One of my friends was doing the these things.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I'm like, I started with the ons and the zins, and then I found the Mr. Vapor.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Man, the flavors are just incredible.

**Jon Kluger:** The.
**Jon Kluger:** The odds.
**Jon Kluger:** I just call the hiccups because you.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, if you need them.
**Jon Kluger:** If you throw one in, not enough.
**Jon Kluger:** If you throw two in, you're losing.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yep.

**Jon Kluger:** Yep.
**Jon Kluger:** The whole time.
**Jon Kluger:** Meanwhile, so Matt's one of our new hires he's shadowing today.
**Jon Kluger:** Matt does nothing of the sort.
**Jon Kluger:** So he's sitting here.
**Jon Kluger:** He lives in New York.
**Jon Kluger:** So I think a can of Zen in New York is like $13 now.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** 1300.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** 1300.

**Matthew Bryce:** You got to take out a second mortgage just for that.

**Jon Kluger:** But.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** But yeah, I actually, I do.

**Matthew Bryce:** I am a cigar smoker.
**Matthew Bryce:** I love cigars.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Of course, once in a.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Once in a while.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Once in a while.

**Jon Kluger:** I do.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I like acid brand.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** The Kuba Kubas.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, that's.
**Jon Kluger:** I grew up.
**Jon Kluger:** My grandfather.
**Jon Kluger:** My first cigar ever was a La Gloria Cubano.
**Jon Kluger:** The Extendos.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** I was like.
**Jon Kluger:** I was like, I want to try yours.
**Jon Kluger:** And he was like, okay, but if you start it, you have to finish it.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Mm.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's a four to five hour session right there.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah, that's a.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** That's a 60 ring band.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah, it's a tree branch.

**Jon Kluger:** I. I took about four puffs, started coughing my.
**Jon Kluger:** My ass off, and then I was, like, bent over ready to puke, and he was just like, are you inhaling it?
**Jon Kluger:** I go, you inhale it.
**Jon Kluger:** He goes, you shouldn't.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm just like.
**Jon Kluger:** That man inhaled those cigars to a day for 20 years.
**Jon Kluger:** He died of cancer, but it wasn't lung cancer.
**Jon Kluger:** Literally, he had prostate cancer.
**Jon Kluger:** But till the day he died, he was smoking those cigars and I was just like, that's insanity.
**Jon Kluger:** That every single time for a scan, they were just like, lungs are clear.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm just like, is that the secret?
**Jon Kluger:** Forget a cigarette?

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I mean, you.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You compare cigars to cigarettes.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I mean, the.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** They put in cigarettes, though.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Holy, man.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It's just ridiculous.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm in.
**Jon Kluger:** Tobacco cuts are here.
**Jon Kluger:** I. I literally have friends who grow for RJ Reynolds, and they're just like, dude, we have to wear hazmat suits when we take care of the crop because they're spraying it with so much.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm just like, that is incredibly concerning.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, what do you mean they're spraying it with so much?
**Jon Kluger:** You have to wear a heads in that suit.
**Jon Kluger:** I go, why do you think I quit smoking as soon as I started working there, dude?
**Jon Kluger:** And I was just like, so you're okay with selling it to me, but you won't do it?
**Jon Kluger:** I go, all right, that's.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a little suss with our friendship because you've been working there for a year now, buddy.
**Jon Kluger:** Why are you just now telling me?

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Right.

**Jon Kluger:** We could dive on in.
**Jon Kluger:** We could probably chat about this all day.
**Jon Kluger:** Jamie, if we end up partnering with each other, I'm going to ask for you to send me a can in the mail.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I'll send you some for sure.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I bought this on Facebook.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It's a metal.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It's aluminum.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Machined aluminum.

**Jon Kluger:** Nice.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** But they make.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You can fit two can.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Two pins of Zen in this one.

**Jon Kluger:** Well, I. I should send you.
**Jon Kluger:** One of my Buddies is a 3D printer.
**Jon Kluger:** He created a 3D printer belt clip to keep this end holstered in nice.
**Jon Kluger:** Just like, I got tired of it making, like, jumbling up my pocket where I can't pull out my keys get and all that.
**Jon Kluger:** So he's like, now I got it on Quick Draw, and I was just.
**Jon Kluger:** I'd love for you to go out to the bars with me, but I know you've been married for five years, but I'd love for you to come out to the bars and when a girl asks if you have one quick drop and see how that go.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I. I bought.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I bought one that was 3D printed off of Etsy, and it has a clip on it.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It goes on your sun visor.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Oh, but the Zen.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** The Zen tens must be a little bit smaller because I can get it in there.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** There's no way in God's green earth it's coming back out.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So I threw it away.

**Jon Kluger:** That's a good idea.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a good concept, though.
**Jon Kluger:** I will say, Jamie, I took a look at your website.
**Jon Kluger:** I got a good idea of what, what you, who you guys are.
**Jon Kluger:** I assume you're looking for essentially a white label partner that you can load your, load our data into or create individual instances.
**Jon Kluger:** Do you currently have a data partner at the time, at this time?
**Jon Kluger:** May I ask who that might be?

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Well, it's funny you ask because your post basically knocks them down with a thumbs down.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Because if you're using Audience Labs, let me put.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** That's what really, that's what really caught my attention.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And I'm like, I was looking over your stuff and looking at, looking at the website.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I'm like, I even, I even, you know, did a side by side comparison in chat GPT and it says one's better than the other.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You know, definitely have your meeting with them and see what it's all about.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** But.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And that's where I'm at today.

**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** No, that's fantastic.
**Jon Kluger:** We actually have at least one to two people every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** Switch over from Audience Lab.
**Jon Kluger:** So one of the things that's very different between us and Audience Lab, Unlimited audience unlimited lead lists, unlimited and limited.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're not putting handcuffs on you.
**Jon Kluger:** We're letting you do exactly what you need to do for your clients and we're even giving your clients the opportunity to go into the portal and explore themselves so you don't have to sit here and worry about, you know, oh crap, I changed one variable.
**Jon Kluger:** Now I have a whole new audience and now I have to pay for a whole new audience.
**Jon Kluger:** I come from a data science background.
**Jon Kluger:** I went to NC State University, gopack where I graduated with a data analytics degree.
**Jon Kluger:** I've spent the last eight years working with top AI and data companies where I've been firsthand working with the product team at Apollo ZoomInfo Seamless.
**Jon Kluger:** I've seen it all, I've experienced it all.
**Jon Kluger:** I know what crap data does and I know what not being able to leverage data does when you're paying an arm and a leg to do so.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, we'll walk you through our platform.
**Jon Kluger:** This is V1.
**Jon Kluger:** V2 will be live February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to be a lot sexier.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to have more integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to have every like the ability to put in any keyword phrase that you want.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now we're operating on 39,842 in 10 topics across B2B and B2C.
**Jon Kluger:** When V2 comes out, that will be unlimited because you can write in whatever you want.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that is when we go through the demo, you'll see I'm only putting in one intent topic that will be allowed in V2.
**Jon Kluger:** You can put in as many as you'd like.
**Jon Kluger:** What I always tell my clients, be cognizant of what terms you put in.
**Jon Kluger:** If something is a borderline where you're like, I don't know, don't add it because you're just adding more to the pool that isn't as precise and focused as you probably want when you're doing intent categories and apps.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that being said, well, as I walk through the platform and we talk about license and white label, I'm going to focus on the white label side so I can explain the different features and the volume of features that you're presented.
**Jon Kluger:** Please feel free to interrupt.
**Jon Kluger:** Along the way I talk a lot and I sometimes I like to interrupt people.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** So we're good.

**Jon Kluger:** We're the dream team.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** So before we, before we get any farther, one question I even.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** One question I even had for Audience Labs.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It's like, where is the data actually sourced from?

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so I can't tell you the exact name of our data provider, but I can give you quite a high level overview.
**Jon Kluger:** So our data provider, we have a very limited contract.
**Jon Kluger:** We are one of less than five people in the world who have this contract.
**Jon Kluger:** We work with the data provider for Fortune 100 companies.
**Jon Kluger:** We take our initial data set, then we have additional 200 data providers that we waterfall into the initial data set to enrich and fill in any of the gaps as well as bringing in additional information.
**Jon Kluger:** What I can tell you is audience lab, zoominfo, Apollo IO all use a data source called 5 by 5.
**Jon Kluger:** 5 by 5 has lost a lot of its luster, shall we say, in the Last couple years.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** 5X5.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** 5x5 is the data provider for that.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** For them, that's their sole data provider.
**Jon Kluger:** We use over 200 data sources.
**Jon Kluger:** So we were essentially built.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see when I run a query for you is you'll see the SQL code.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason you see that is our technical founder spent the last 15 years leveraging this data set to work with Fortune 100 companies directly.
**Jon Kluger:** It was a rudimentary SQL pool that was not usable by you, me or anyone else who didn't want to do SQL pools.
**Jon Kluger:** He was able to gartner a contract with the data provider to be able to package and resell the data earlier this year.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, technically last year because it's January right now.
**Jon Kluger:** That being said, Audience Lab, we have nothing to do with their data.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't touch any of their data.
**Jon Kluger:** We have no data sources in common.
**Jon Kluger:** You might see an ad from Audience Lab nowadays where they're calling us out, where they're saying we're buying their data from them.
**Jon Kluger:** That is incredibly false.
**Jon Kluger:** We have no relationship with them whatsoever.
**Jon Kluger:** Their CEO has kind of lost his mind.
**Jon Kluger:** He comments on every single one of our posts.
**Jon Kluger:** He literally is sending emails to people, switching over, just going off.
**Jon Kluger:** And we've talked legally, internally about a cease and desist.
**Jon Kluger:** And I said, don't.
**Jon Kluger:** He's just destroying himself.
**Jon Kluger:** He's making him.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Let him burn himself down.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly like his comments are.
**Jon Kluger:** Their data is terrible.
**Jon Kluger:** They rent it from us.
**Jon Kluger:** How does that make sense?

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Well, now, wait a second.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** If, if, if your data is terrible and they're renting it from Audience Labs, Audience Labs data is terrible to begin with.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** And they're saying we're selling it for cheaper, too.
**Jon Kluger:** It's almost like you're saying my business doesn't make sense.
**Jon Kluger:** These guys are selling my business at a better price and it sucks.
**Jon Kluger:** It doesn't make sense.
**Jon Kluger:** So anything and everything out there, I'm telling you right now, we're just doing us.
**Jon Kluger:** And we continuously have customers and testimonials that are fantastic.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll actually show you one at the end of this.
**Jon Kluger:** I was on a call yesterday.
**Jon Kluger:** One of our clients literally said you halved our costs and you doubled our conversions.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's on an ad, not even on the license.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's pretty spectacular what we're able to do.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason that I joined the team very early on was they literally showed me our data and our capabilities.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was like, this is a game changer.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that, we can dive on in.
**Jon Kluger:** What you're going to see here is a live account.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't do this whole BS where I'm in a playground and I'm showing you exactly what I want to show you.
**Jon Kluger:** If we go in here and we start looking up intent topics and there's something that doesn't exactly fit what you want.
**Jon Kluger:** That's, that's reality right now.
**Jon Kluger:** In V2, you'll be able to put whatever you want in.
**Jon Kluger:** We have promotional pricing right now that when you sign up for V1, you get grandfathered in in perpetuity for V2.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so with that being said, this is our homepage.
**Jon Kluger:** This is a highlight of our Super Pixel.
**Jon Kluger:** Each white label count comes with 10 licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** Each license to Start with, you can add an additional license as well.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll go over pricing at the end.
**Jon Kluger:** Each license comes with five super pixels.
**Jon Kluger:** You can set these on your website.
**Jon Kluger:** They can set it on their multiple websites, whatever it is, and it will actually track website visitors and subdomains.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I really like this is I'm sure a lot of your clients are not the most tech savvy or data aware.
**Jon Kluger:** So we actually can provide a pretty easy visual representation here.
**Jon Kluger:** As you'll see on the left side, we highlight the top pages.
**Jon Kluger:** In the middle you'll see top sources.
**Jon Kluger:** So.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you're running ads, the top sources.
**Jon Kluger:** If ads or Facebook is number one, then you can be like, all the effort we're doing is fantastic, guys, let's keep it up.
**Jon Kluger:** And then on the far right, you'll see top cities.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I like top cities is we actually get pretty granular.
**Jon Kluger:** So when you look at Dallas Fort Worth area right now, you'll see it looks like just one hodgepodge of identification.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, we can get pretty granular with that.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say you're a retailer and you have a store in Dallas and you're seeing, hey, actually a lot of your traffic is coming in Fort Worth.
**Jon Kluger:** Maybe you should consider opening up another store in Fort Worth just based off of the traffic visitors that you're seeing.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we can zoom into a granular point where you're actually looking at zip codes or even individuals.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, there's two in the same building.
**Jon Kluger:** Nice.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** And see, that's a question.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So I, as far as far as the Super Pixel, you know, audience lab, I have that available to me.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I've never used it.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It's not my thing.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I basically sell intent, perfect for marketing purposes.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You know, I've targeted solar mortgage, commercial roofing, H vac, stuff like that.

**Jon Kluger:** That's a perfect use case.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** But now, here's my thing.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** When we create an audience, I've got two offshore employees that they're based in Pakistan.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** They are fantastic.

**Jon Kluger:** Hell yeah.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** So now looking at this, every morning when data is refreshed and sent out, we do a daily refresh.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And you know, new records are sent out daily.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** They have to, depending on the client, we have to create a heat map.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You know, because what I, what I tell my clients is, you know, say you got a commercial, say we got a solar company in Texas we're working with and they're throwing, you know, $10,000, 20,000, $50,000 a month at Texas as a whole, we create a heat Map and say, don't put ad spend here, don't put ad spend here.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Don't do it here.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Double down here, double down and triple here.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And that's been huge.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Now it looks like you almost have a heat map.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Unless.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Unless it's a little bit different in what we're doing.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You know what we're doing.

**Jon Kluger:** No, you're 100, right.
**Jon Kluger:** This operates as the heat map.
**Jon Kluger:** And the thing is, is we identify at a 40 to 70% rate.
**Jon Kluger:** So what that actually looks like too is you can actually identify the addresses where these are all coming from in the source, the user path.
**Jon Kluger:** And then here's the kicker that you'll really like.
**Jon Kluger:** Jamie.
**Jon Kluger:** So you've just.
**Jon Kluger:** This is just website visitors.
**Jon Kluger:** This isn't even an intent built.
**Jon Kluger:** These are some of the data points we can pull from a built website.
**Jon Kluger:** Visitor income.
**Jon Kluger:** Are they a homeowner?
**Jon Kluger:** Are they not a homeowner?
**Jon Kluger:** What companies?
**Jon Kluger:** Email address, phone device, IP, all of their behavior.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** What about DNC on personal home?

**Jon Kluger:** So currently we don't have a DNC.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't have DNC cross reference.
**Jon Kluger:** We have email validation coming out in V2, automatic email validation.
**Jon Kluger:** What we can easily do is we have a pretty extensive API.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to have your existing DNC list and our results come through the API and omit out the dncs, you can do that.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Because I've got a couple of mortgage companies that use.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** They use it strictly for outbound and I don't send them lists that have not been scrubbed for dnc.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, you can totally do that.
**Jon Kluger:** With our integrations in v2, we'll have Google Sheets built in as well and like 10 others.
**Jon Kluger:** But what you can see here is let's just say HubSpot, you can create or update contacts, you can seamlessly transfer.
**Jon Kluger:** We've got go high level.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I have ghl.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, that's perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what we use as well.
**Jon Kluger:** It's super duper easy to bring you in.
**Jon Kluger:** We've got Klaviyo for those customers that like to do large sends Salesforce Google Ads connector.
**Jon Kluger:** I know, I know.
**Jon Kluger:** That's not something that Audience Lab has currently or operates it.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, we had one client who literally switched over because he said they've been telling them they were going to add Google Ads connector for six months and they have no intention.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** That's.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And that.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** That's all.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You know, we don't do a whole lot.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** We.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I mean, what I want to say that's a manual, you know, we have to create a Lookalike and then we have to back feed it to, you know, Google that lookalike audience.

**Jon Kluger:** So we make that a lot easier, don't you worry, with what we're able to build.
**Jon Kluger:** But additionally we've got mailchimp, beehive, pipedrive, Slack connector and HubSpot as well.
**Jon Kluger:** That's just currently, like I said, we're adding a whole lot more.
**Jon Kluger:** So V2, what we decided was we wanted to do one nice big refresh and then we're going to continuously add and improve to V2.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's why we have additional integrations already built that you can't see.
**Jon Kluger:** We just want to make sure we aren't throwing them out there and then not telling people, hey, we just released this.
**Jon Kluger:** So like we're having like a big release announcement.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm trying to do it on Valentine's Day.
**Jon Kluger:** Everyone else wants to do it the day after.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm like, it's so much more fun if we tell everyone who's working on Valentine's Day you get a new tool.
**Jon Kluger:** Like they might be home alone, but at least they have something new and fun to work with.
**Jon Kluger:** That might just be me talking about myself.
**Jon Kluger:** It's really great.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing that could also be very valuable for some of your services based on clients.
**Jon Kluger:** So we actually have direct mail built in.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Not only I saw that on your.

**Jon Kluger:** Website, we have campaign triggers.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say someone goes down to a request a quote page on one of your service based clients.
**Jon Kluger:** You can actually put the URL path as where they land.
**Jon Kluger:** Once they hit that path, it creates a trigger.
**Jon Kluger:** That trigger will either select the postcard or a letter and then you can choose how often the follow up frequency is.
**Jon Kluger:** You're going to have this if they abandoned their fill out, if they filled out their contact form, whatever you choose, we can have this essentially filled out.
**Jon Kluger:** I always tell people I recommend to start if you're going to do it.
**Jon Kluger:** Look at people that have filled out a contact us or some sort of that form, have that redirect to a specific page, then have that page create the trigger because then it creates more of a hey, I'm supposed to speak with these guys next week.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh they even sent me mail already.
**Jon Kluger:** I love that they actually care about me.
**Jon Kluger:** Or hey, I spoke to these guys last week and they actually did a follow up where now I'm getting a discount for 10% off my first service.
**Jon Kluger:** Hell yeah, I'm definitely going to work with them now.
**Jon Kluger:** So it can create a really nice flow and the cost starts at 90 cents a send with postage included, and that's done.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay, now let me ask you this.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So I am trying to, you know, outbound with TCPA and different regulations in, in different verticals.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I know some people that are in insurance and they cannot cold call, they cannot cold email, they cannot cold text.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Now the one lady I'm looking to work with, she's actually in Atlanta and her biggest thing is leads.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And you know, could we do.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Somebody comes to her website?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** We can see this is not my, my wheelhouse.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I kind of everyday stuff and I've got my guide behind the scenes.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So I may ask questions.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It may sound stupid to you, sorry, Matt.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** But so, I mean, we can do that, but we also do an email, you know, kickback as well.

**Jon Kluger:** So what, what I would recommend on the email side is every day we just export this list into your CRM and you have that export or that pushover.
**Jon Kluger:** Then that's just a trigger to then send an email.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And this, this is gonna be recorded.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I can send this to my, my VA, right?

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** 100.
**Jon Kluger:** What's also really nice about direct mail, just to show you what it looks like, it's really simple.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to even just upload a CSV and just do a blast for people that are already born leads or maybe someone hasn't converted, you can easily set that up and just launch that whenever you want.
**Jon Kluger:** So it doesn't only have to be campaign based or trigger based.
**Jon Kluger:** You can just do it whenever.
**Jon Kluger:** So the industries that you work with, where you can't do cold outreach, direct mail is not included in that.
**Jon Kluger:** You can send direct mail to everybody and they can't DNC direct mail at the end of the day.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Right.

**Jon Kluger:** So direct mail is a really good use case.
**Jon Kluger:** What, what we also like to do is imagine you have the addresses of everyone in a specific region.
**Jon Kluger:** You filter it down, you export it, you filter it down to specific states.
**Jon Kluger:** You can then take those, those records, throw them in a chat GPT and say, plan me a knocking path.
**Jon Kluger:** I want to go to the houses of each of the people that visited my website, knock on the door and introduce myself.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say you're a roofing company.
**Jon Kluger:** You could literally go in and knock on someone's door and say, hey, just in the neighborhood.
**Jon Kluger:** Just was curious.
**Jon Kluger:** You know, I noticed a couple of your shingles were missing.
**Jon Kluger:** Have you been thinking about, you know, potentially getting some roofing services done?
**Jon Kluger:** And the person would be like, oh, yeah, I have.
**Jon Kluger:** He goes, what, what do you guys call?
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, Jamie's Roofing.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, I'm pretty sure I was just on your website.
**Jon Kluger:** It's so funny that you're here.
**Jon Kluger:** It's like, well, we, we really care about our customers.
**Jon Kluger:** We think about being proactive, not reactive.
**Jon Kluger:** So, you know, I was just in the neighborhood, driving around one of my clients, and I saw that you had a little bit of damage on your roof, and I wanted to introduce myself.
**Jon Kluger:** Now you added that little personal touch.
**Jon Kluger:** My God, the conversion.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Never thought about that.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** That's incredible.

**Jon Kluger:** And that can also be used when we create audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** So think about the people with high levels of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** High levels.
**Jon Kluger:** We look at immediate buying signals.
**Jon Kluger:** You might not be able to cold call them, but you can go knock on their door.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** But see, with, with I, I, as long as they're not on a dnc.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And that's why we scrub our list.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I'm like, so, excuse me, like commercial roofing, resi roofing, H vac, Plum.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I have not really found anything that says you can't cold call them.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** So, I mean, that's what we're, that's what we're pushing.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I mean, I sell three layers.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** We do, we do a re entry.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** We do data intent.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** We do our heat maps.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You know, portion of it is for figuring out where to put ad spend.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You know, you're doing your outbound.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** We're, we're taking old, which I have not utilized, sad to say, I'm not a techie guy.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So I've had audience labs for a while, and I just realized we can actually take my clients cold leads and back feed them to our, to audience labs to, you know, watch and see when that person's going to raise their hand next.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** They're back in the market for a new roof or whatever it may be.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** That's one of the things I recommend to all the clients is we actually like to have that operate within the CRM.
**Jon Kluger:** So whenever we push over new data queries to your CRM, you can build within, go high level.
**Jon Kluger:** If someone's intent level changes from none to low, medium, or high, create a flow or a trigger that then enrolls them into a call list or an outreach list or whatever it is, because that's the things that these CRMs are built to be able to do.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's where we look at that and say, we know what we do.
**Jon Kluger:** We know what we're good at.
**Jon Kluger:** We're good at data and identifying the people that come to your website.
**Jon Kluger:** At the end of the day, we don't want to add 15 extra features within our, our application that distracts us from ensuring we're delivering you the best intent data in the market.
**Jon Kluger:** So I know I keep talking intent.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing I want to show you real quick, these are the polls from this week.
**Jon Kluger:** So on January 26th alone, look at the record count that we've done.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** So what is, what's the, what's the search at that million mark?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** What are you guys searching for?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** What, what generalized search is it?

**Jon Kluger:** Let me see.
**Jon Kluger:** Seniority level in the United States.
**Jon Kluger:** Validation.
**Jon Kluger:** I was just.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** What are these people looking for?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I guess is my better question.

**Jon Kluger:** Costs in logistics, moving costs and logistics.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Is that what you said?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay, can you, can you show me what commercial roofing looks like?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Because here is one of my big problems.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So when I go into Al and I try to do B2B, it seems like I get so much people that, you know, oh, they're.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It's not even like they're tied to commercial roofing or they wouldn't be looking for a commercial roof or roof repair or a, you know, flat roof or steel roof.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It's just like, it seems like the data sometimes in B2B is not there.

**Jon Kluger:** So our B2B data is incredibly extensive.
**Jon Kluger:** Transparently, we need to add.
**Jon Kluger:** We're adding more topics because where we look at B2B is we can list like for example, Salesforce.
**Jon Kluger:** If I wanted to target everyone who was using Salesforce within their B2B organization, I would put Salesforce.
**Jon Kluger:** So right now B2B has everyone and anyone when it comes to basically softwares and competitors.
**Jon Kluger:** We're adding in B2 another 30,010 topics and the ability for you to just free form your exact phrase.
**Jon Kluger:** So on the B2B side, we've literally had this conversation with a bunch of people where they're like, the B2B for the B2B from audience lab has been trash.
**Jon Kluger:** And we recognize that.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're trying to make us one of the most robust and accurate B2B and tech platforms.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Because that's my big struggle right now.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Commercial roofing seems to be the worst in B2B.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, 100%.
**Jon Kluger:** So I know you mentioned H Vac, so there's a whole bunch of different H Vac options.
**Jon Kluger:** This is on the B2C side.
**Jon Kluger:** So for this example, I'll just run a quick B2C.
**Jon Kluger:** Cause I just checked, I added.
**Jon Kluger:** I asked our internal team to add commercial looping as a B2B intent topic.
**Jon Kluger:** I didn't see it when I just checked.
**Jon Kluger:** That usually takes maybe A day or two.
**Jon Kluger:** So if there's a crucial intent topic you need that you don't see for some reason in V1, we can add it.
**Jon Kluger:** V2 will allow for you to freeform, add whatever you want.
**Jon Kluger:** So I just want to be transparent in terms of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** We only look at the last two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't go back months, we don't go back years, we don't do any of that because two weeks buyer cycle.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have any form of intent, let's say auto, like auto repair.
**Jon Kluger:** My car wasn't starting yesterday.
**Jon Kluger:** Am I going to call and wait three weeks to get my car fixed?
**Jon Kluger:** Now I'm going to start reaching out to mechanics, reaching out to aaa, reaching out to everyone within that timeframe.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not only that you can refresh every single day and get a whole new set.
**Jon Kluger:** So I'll actually show you where we can save queries, have them automatically update, have them automatically push to your ad accounts, have them automatically do everything where if you find a good intent niche, all you have to do is sit there and let it refresh every single day.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Now, when, like on your say, you do an H vac initial search, what is the, what is the minimum?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Can you do 24 hours?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Can you do 48?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we can do this to one day if you want to.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I wrote, because that's, that's.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** One of my selling points.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I always tell people, I mean, I mean, the intent is there.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** The first person you know gets to that intent wins.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I mean, essentially, as long as you've got a good setter and a good closer.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** If I'm putting this data in for you, that is like literally 24 hours old, before it gets a week old, before it gets to a Legion marketplace, before it goes through a funnel, before it goes to an ad, before calls, we're putting the data in front of you.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.
**Jon Kluger:** And we can automatically have that happen.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't even have to worry about it.
**Jon Kluger:** You, you talked about the heat map update on every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** You talked about all the things you deliver on day to day.
**Jon Kluger:** We can have it, we can have it primed and ready to go to either send over or to automatically update your, your meta ads every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** You don't even have to worry about it.
**Jon Kluger:** You set it up once you're good to rock.
**Jon Kluger:** And now we'll pull up a sample for you.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll look at the last two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** Is there a specific location when we talk locations?
**Jon Kluger:** I just want to give you this caveat.
**Jon Kluger:** When you do cities understand that the cities create a border.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not the metropolitan area.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to do a metropolitan area, just go into chat GPT, tell me, give me all the zip codes in a 50 mile radius of X, y and z, put it into a CSV format, remove the top column, and then what you'll be able to do is I'll just do this for a quick example.
**Jon Kluger:** You select the zip, you select in, and then you just upload the file and that's how you're able to filter for zip.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** So that's how I, that's how I kind of do it with audience labs.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I, I'll go into chat.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I mean, I run chat GPD a lot.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And I'll just go, hey, I need zip codes, 35 mile radius.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I mean, I'm just outside of Grand Rapids, Michigan.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So right now, I mean, show me Michigan as a whole.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Because what I do is I sell state position.

**Jon Kluger:** Then do we want them to be homeowners?

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah, absolutely not.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Renters.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So homeowners.

**Jon Kluger:** Yes.
**Jon Kluger:** And then I can do probable.
**Jon Kluger:** When we say probable, it's.
**Jon Kluger:** It's okay in terms of accuracy because what you'll run into if we're going to do probable, what we're going to also add is we're going to add income.
**Jon Kluger:** Actually, let's do net worth in.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll do at least 75 grand.
**Jon Kluger:** Even though someone who owns a home is worth More than 75 grand.
**Jon Kluger:** Typically.
**Jon Kluger:** But this will just help us omit out any of the probable homeowners that are in.
**Jon Kluger:** Negative for net worth.
**Jon Kluger:** Very negative for net worth.
**Jon Kluger:** You probably aren't a homeowner.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** And what I, what I've seen anyway, somebody searching for a new furnace or something like that is going to be a homeowner.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** They're not gonna be a renter anyway.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So this just helps out, weed out a little bit more.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** Because at the end of the day, the more narrow you can get your intent list when you load it into meta, the better it performs, assuming you have enough statistical points.
**Jon Kluger:** So I'm not saying throw 10 people in, but like, if you have a thousand, that's fantastic because then Andromeda AI, the meta ads expert that everyone loves now, will do all the work for you.
**Jon Kluger:** Essentially, if you give it a Data set of 100,000, you're going to.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I'm listening.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I'm just gonna take my sweatshirt off screen.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Go ahead and keep talking.

**Jon Kluger:** If you say give them a data set of a million records, then Andromeda can't.
**Jon Kluger:** Can't find those niches that are the perfect fit within this intent data to then amplify that opportunity.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, great shirt.
**Jon Kluger:** Hell, yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** You're two for two.
**Jon Kluger:** Come on, Jamie.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay, okay.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Hold on a second.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** If you like the movie Goodfellas, can I do this?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** How do I.

**Jon Kluger:** There.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll stop presenting so you can share.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** No, I just want to kill the freaking background filter.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, you see the little camera on the bottom?
**Jon Kluger:** Click the arrow up, and you'll see the blur background option.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay, so I got.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm gonna hold that.
**Jon Kluger:** You can't refuse.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Well, if you've seen the movie Goodfellas, I know Matt's here, but I'm Italian.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I've always had, like, huge interest in mafia.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Well, if you've seen the movie Goodfellas, in the beginning of the movie, Henry Hill is played by Chris Cerrone.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You see all that?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, is that, like, a family friend?

**Matthew Bryce:** That's amazing.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Is a friend of mine.

**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, What?

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** That's awesome.

**Jon Kluger:** Yep.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Chris.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** My wife actually makes these T shirts for him to sell at his events.

**Jon Kluger:** That is awesome.
**Jon Kluger:** I I It's.
**Jon Kluger:** It's back in a closet right now.
**Jon Kluger:** But there's a brand I really like called Kith cheat K I T H. They just released a Sopranos collab where I got myself a Bada Bing varsity jacket.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Fantastic.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Actually, I was.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I was.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I was talking to Chris last night.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah, I was talking casual.

**Jon Kluger:** Casual.
**Jon Kluger:** No, it's.
**Jon Kluger:** It's pretty funny.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll tell you a quick story.
**Jon Kluger:** So my dad's from Irvington, New Jersey, originally.
**Jon Kluger:** He.
**Jon Kluger:** He worked as a DOJ prosecutor for probably 40 years before he retired.
**Jon Kluger:** His favorite story of all time is he goes out to Vegas in the 80s to do a case.
**Jon Kluger:** He's out in the casino, and he's just, you know, walking around, and he hears the guy on the phone on a payphone go.
**Jon Kluger:** So all I have to do is tell him I know Jimmy the Rat, and I can get in to go see Frankie and the guy and goes, all right, all right.
**Jon Kluger:** So my dad's standing there.
**Jon Kluger:** He's like.
**Jon Kluger:** He's like, I got my badge on me, so if anyone gives me any problems, I got my DOJ badge so they'll leave me alone.
**Jon Kluger:** He follows this guy.
**Jon Kluger:** He tells the guy at the door who he knows.
**Jon Kluger:** He walks in.
**Jon Kluger:** He's in a room of 40 people sitting on a stool, smoking a cigarette.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Is Frank Sinai Sinatra.

**Jon Kluger:** And.
**Jon Kluger:** And my dad was like, I stood in the back.
**Jon Kluger:** I was not seen.
**Jon Kluger:** He goes.
**Jon Kluger:** Because three of the 40 people in that room.
**Jon Kluger:** I was there to investigate.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure.

**Jon Kluger:** But he's got some great stories from back in the day.
**Jon Kluger:** He, when he was in New Jersey, his buddy would always pull up to the, to the.
**Jon Kluger:** He was one of his buddies was related to some of the guys in New York.
**Jon Kluger:** So he'd always come in to sell some of the product out of New York.
**Jon Kluger:** So he'd always pop the trunk and he'd be like, Jerry, you need some condoms?
**Jon Kluger:** And my dad would be like, sure.
**Jon Kluger:** He opens the trunk, he goes, I've got about 10,000.
**Jon Kluger:** How many you need?
**Jon Kluger:** And my dad was like, Brother, I'm 17, like five.
**Jon Kluger:** But anyway, I ran that query.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see here is it says 15 to 20 minutes.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a lot.
**Jon Kluger:** It's just there to make every impatient person show the hell out.
**Jon Kluger:** All you have to do is check your phone, check an email and hit refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** What you're going to see here is H Vac Intent in Michigan.
**Jon Kluger:** You're going to see their personal information on the left.
**Jon Kluger:** We scroll over to the right.
**Jon Kluger:** You'll see their business related in their financials.
**Jon Kluger:** So as we scroll up so you'll see net worth income range where they work.
**Jon Kluger:** This one is an administrator chemical company.
**Jon Kluger:** This is on the B2C side.
**Jon Kluger:** When we do the B2B, it's a little more extensive than some of this information.
**Jon Kluger:** But as you can see, there's still a fairly decent bit when we talk about the B2B information.
**Jon Kluger:** Now on the left side here, you're going to see a range of intent low to high.
**Jon Kluger:** We tell everybody, even if they are low, we do not put them on your radar unless there's consistent behavior.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't know if you have kids, but let's say you have kids and you hand your phone to a young child.
**Jon Kluger:** They go on your phone and they look up cocomelon and they're watching a YouTube video for 20 minutes.
**Jon Kluger:** You're not showing intensity, Coco melon.
**Jon Kluger:** We know that.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're not going to act like you are even at a low level intent.
**Jon Kluger:** We recommend you add those people to your paid ad attempts.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, do we say cold email them, cold call them?
**Jon Kluger:** You could cold email them, but I wouldn't recommend cold calling because that's going to be a lot of lift.
**Jon Kluger:** But anyone with a medium, especially a high, like I have a client who does H Vac.
**Jon Kluger:** He literally takes the high intent people and makes that knocking list as well where he goes door to door can.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** You filter by score category so we can cut all that low and medium?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I mean, sometimes I mean medium intent.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And I'm just comparing from what I know with audience labs, they.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** What they say is they have a score.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** How they score these, these, these records.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You're not getting anything in your records list or, you know, your CSV that's less than a 90 score, which means they have shown intent.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Shown intent.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Shown intent.

**Jon Kluger:** Essentially the same in terms of our requirement of a threshold.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, when you download these, the CSV will look like this.
**Jon Kluger:** If you don't notice, on the left here, we have the SHA256, which is why our targeting on our meta ads is so fantastic.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** What is that?

**Jon Kluger:** That's just the Facebook unique identifier.
**Jon Kluger:** So instead of you being like Jamie149872, they just give you a unique identifier that's a huge numerical value.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** And then I have no idea what that was.

**Jon Kluger:** And that's how they develop essentially a profile on you within their system.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you think about this, I always joke with people.
**Jon Kluger:** I was like, 90% of my list, 90% of my initial phone usage back in the day when I first got my iPhone, everything was signed in with Facebook, which means Facebook has a record of what I'm connected to on every other one of these apps.
**Jon Kluger:** So Facebook's been building a profile on me, my behavior across their apps, what I follow, what I comment on, what I interact with.
**Jon Kluger:** They developed their own profile of me for the last 15, 20 years.
**Jon Kluger:** Incredible.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I have no idea.

**Jon Kluger:** When you take our intent, we're saying to Facebook, hey, we're looking at these people that we've identified as having intent across the Internet.
**Jon Kluger:** Now you guys take it, start running ads, make it a very simple and clear value prop on the ad, because I always joke with people, when are you on Facebook or Instagram?
**Jon Kluger:** Two most common places, the toilet, the tv, that's the most time that people spend scrolling.
**Jon Kluger:** So with that in mind, we always say have the simplest feed or the simplest ad, because if someone's scrolling and not paying attention, they need something that's, oh, I do need that.
**Jon Kluger:** Quick.
**Jon Kluger:** What Andromeda is doing on the background is it's looking at the SHA256 and it's analyzing for commonalities for everyone that's created that's converted as a lead within our initial intent list.
**Jon Kluger:** So what they're essentially then doing is developing their own targeting that goes beyond our specific intent to everyone across meta because they have their own profile.
**Jon Kluger:** That goes even deeper where they can literally know, hey, Steve posted a photo of his house when he bought his house.
**Jon Kluger:** He's a homeowner.
**Jon Kluger:** Hey, this guy complains about his H Vac not working well on his posts.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's target him.
**Jon Kluger:** So it starts doing all of the lifting.
**Jon Kluger:** And the beautiful part is, look out.
**Jon Kluger:** Look how populated it is.
**Jon Kluger:** We're over like a 95 match on this.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** So could you.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So, so this is the way we.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Using.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Using that sha.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Using that.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** We can actually.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So if I'm working, if I'm working with a big solar company and using that, basically I can put that ad, or they can put use.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Using this as a.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** As a.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** An audience, they could put their ad directly in front of those people by using that code.

**Jon Kluger:** Essentially.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, essentially.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Or yes, yes.

**Jon Kluger:** Assuming those persons, those people are active.
**Jon Kluger:** Because the thing I mean by that is my mom has a Facebook.
**Jon Kluger:** She never uses Facebook.
**Jon Kluger:** So she might be on this and match to the sha, but she might never open Facebook.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay, okay, I get that.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So I don't want to say, yes, they'll do a push notification or something like that.
**Jon Kluger:** That'd be great.
**Jon Kluger:** But I just want to be realistic.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, let's say we love this list.
**Jon Kluger:** You select download all, we say H vac Mi, H vac M I.
**Jon Kluger:** Then we hit save.
**Jon Kluger:** This is where you're going to get excited, Jamie.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to take a couple minutes to process this, but in the meantime, look what we can do.
**Jon Kluger:** We can schedule how often we want it to refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** Every single day never stops.
**Jon Kluger:** Guess what else we can do?
**Jon Kluger:** We can schedule it to an ad account every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** It never stops.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you want your ad account to be getting the new people every day and pushing out the ones that are more than two weeks or more than a week or more than a day, depending on however niche you want it to be, you can have it set up just to do that.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, you can run unlimited queries, you can run unlimited refreshes, you can run unlimited lists, whatever your part desires.
**Jon Kluger:** Like I said before, I come from a data background.
**Jon Kluger:** The first thing they teach you in statistics is you need hypothesis and you need a test group.
**Jon Kluger:** You need to be able to experiment, you need to be able to build new audiences, you need to be able to test other groups.
**Jon Kluger:** If we tell you you can only have one audience per customer of yours, how are you ever going to build out?
**Jon Kluger:** How you ever.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Oh, that's where I'm stuck.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** And we alleviate that pain because we don't Think you should be stuck.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't think you should be charged on a lead basis or on an audience basis because all it takes is one person to slip up and accidentally do a 1 million record call and now you're shit out of luck.
**Jon Kluger:** Right?
**Jon Kluger:** And we don't want that.
**Jon Kluger:** So all of this can be set up.
**Jon Kluger:** If we go over here to save queries, you'll see we've got one right here where they're refreshing it.
**Jon Kluger:** You can hit view, you can see the first one was, was done, the second one was scheduled and completed yesterday.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to export the new ones as a CSV, you can, you want to even just delete it and have it stop, you can, it's super duper easy.
**Jon Kluger:** And as I mentioned, with the integrations, every single one of your white labeled accounts, it's this wouldn't say the target IQ up top, it would say your company, the dropdown could show their websites and then all of the users would just be able to do give them five logins if you want.
**Jon Kluger:** I always just say just let them share one if they want because it's easier than them jumping around.
**Jon Kluger:** They can come in here, look at the visitor identification, they can look at the analytics on the visitor identification, the page feeds, the background of the device type, the traffic source, the income levels, the audiences, all of this.
**Jon Kluger:** And this will be even more robust in V2.
**Jon Kluger:** Now here comes the fun part is pricing.
**Jon Kluger:** So let me zoom in because I don't know why it's so zoomed out.
**Jon Kluger:** So on the white label here, what's going to be included is right off the bat, you get 10 licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** Any license after your 10th is only $100.
**Jon Kluger:** Our website, when V2 goes live, will list our starting price at a minimum of $750 for a license without an API, you're getting API included on white label.
**Jon Kluger:** What that means is if your clients come and see who you're white labeling from, they're seeing a price of a thousand bucks not to work with you.
**Jon Kluger:** Meanwhile, you're paying per license, let's say you get another five.
**Jon Kluger:** You know, that's pictures.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're saying you're doing it per license, you've got 15 licenses, you're only paying about 300 license, you can turn around.
**Jon Kluger:** I, I had a customer yesterday who said I sell them for two grand.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was, he's like, is that okay?
**Jon Kluger:** I go do whatever the hell you want.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, just get it man.
**Jon Kluger:** Like it's good job then.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** That's the thing.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It's like, I have white label, but I have never sold it white label to anybody.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I just do everything and I. I upcharge everything.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** So for this, all you can literally do is you could offset your costs.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, may I ask, like, what are you currently paying with audience Lab?

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I was paying.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** What was I paying?
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Like 16.97amonth.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And that was for eight and eight audiences.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And it's been slow for the last few months.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So I. I downgraded, which really hurts because now I only get four audiences and that's 997amonth.

**Jon Kluger:** Now, to get things started together, I can ask internally about potentially getting you down to the 3,000amonth.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to start with testing with us, what you could also do is go for a single license.
**Jon Kluger:** If after a month you go, jonathan, I love this.
**Jon Kluger:** I want to do white label.
**Jon Kluger:** You can.
**Jon Kluger:** What I personally think is I can go internally.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say how many clients instances would you need right now?

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Like verticals, you're talking.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, if we had individual instances for each of your customers where they could have unlimited, how many would you want to.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, how many do you currently have?

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Five, probably.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah, probably.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Someone there.

**Jon Kluger:** What I can do is I can talk internally to see if we can do a lower threshold on the white label.
**Jon Kluger:** The thing is, is the cost per license after that might not be a hundred dollars.
**Jon Kluger:** So I want to make sure we become a good deal for you.
**Jon Kluger:** Now that might be, say, twenty five hundred dollars and for the first five licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** And then after that, I might be able to get it to 100 each additional.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** So if I don't.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** If I don't really utilize and I, and I always, you know, keep white label.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I mean, it's.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I don't think it's additional costs through audience labs.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I don't think it is.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Maybe it is.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I don't know.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** But like I said, I don't really.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I don't sell it as a white label.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I just basically utilize it for audiences and I send it out in CSV.

**Jon Kluger:** So you send it out in CSVs, then just get a single license quarterly, and it will cost you 500amonth.
**Jon Kluger:** And then if you get to a point where you want to start selling white label, you can start presenting your quarterly.
**Jon Kluger:** Not your quarterly, your single license.
**Jon Kluger:** Have it in front of them, essentially walking them through, saying, this is what we use the tool for.
**Jon Kluger:** This is all this.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want your own version where you can come in and do all of this dedicated to just you, it will Cost you XYZ amount a month and you can get a pulse check from your clients and then determine if you want to upgrade to white label.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what I recommend.
**Jon Kluger:** I think all you need is today I can send this to you.
**Jon Kluger:** And the nice part is, is if you sign up for B1, these prices are what I'm going to guarantee you in perpetuity even when V2 goes live.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Good.

**Jon Kluger:** So that means let's say you do the quarterly for a single license and you come to me and you go, Jonathan, now I want to upgrade.
**Jon Kluger:** I will still be able to get you these prices even though online requirements probably going to have a higher threshold for white label because you are a grandfathered in V1 customer.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you were today I sent the strike link to purchase the quarterly partnership which is 500amonth paid up front.
**Jon Kluger:** You would be locked in at that 500 price in perpetuity.
**Jon Kluger:** You email me at john retargetiq.com and you'll have your license set up with unlimited audience building, unlimited updates, unlimited everything within 24 hours.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Well, since I just paid for my audience labs yesterday and it was $1,000, I can't do it today.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I probably, it's going to be probably two weeks before I can do it.

**Jon Kluger:** What, what's your email address again, John @retargetiq.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay, do you guys have a sandbox by VA complaint or.

**Jon Kluger:** No, not currently.
**Jon Kluger:** Our data, our data partner won't allow for us to do that.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Now if you wanted to maybe get a week early access so that you can put them side by side and then do all of that, I can ask internally for that so you can directly compare.
**Jon Kluger:** You can do everything in that regard.
**Jon Kluger:** But I, it's.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not legally allowed to give away any data or give access without a contract in place because of liabilities.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay, let me figure this out.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I like this.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I mean, I mean just everything seems just next level above Al.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** But like I said, I just, I just paid for it yesterday.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Renewed yesterday.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You're good.

**Jon Kluger:** Check their contract.
**Jon Kluger:** A lot of software companies have buyer's remorse clause that if you cancel within 48 hours and payment they have to refund you.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I'll look at that.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** But the problem is I, I'm, I am used to al.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I know how it works.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I know what I'm, I need to do in there.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** This, I, it's, this seems like it's a little bit of, a little bit more of a learning process like in audience labs.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I'm sure you've I'm sure you have.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You used Audience Labs.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** So you can go in there and you can type in.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** It's basically AI generative.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** What do you.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** What you know, what is your, you know, client you're specifically looking for, what they're interested in.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** You can type it all in there, hit Enter, and boom, you've got all your keys, keywords for that, that search query.

**Jon Kluger:** So that's.
**Jon Kluger:** That's V2 will be a lot more intuitive and easy to use.
**Jon Kluger:** What I will say is I need you locked in before February 15 if I want to be able to honor that price, because once you is live, then they want me to start charging V2 prices.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, well, that.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** That shouldn't be a problem.

**Jon Kluger:** Excellent with that.
**Jon Kluger:** Just adds up.
**Jon Kluger:** I have another four minutes so we can keep chatting.
**Jon Kluger:** I just want to be transparent.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** I've got a call in just a couple of minutes too, so I probably should get going.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I have some questions, but you kind of pretty much.

**Jon Kluger:** If anything comes up, just email me.
**Jon Kluger:** You can text me.
**Jon Kluger:** My.
**Jon Kluger:** My phone number should be in my email signature.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll send you this over email right now.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll send you the offer so you have it.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** And then.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah, definitely.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** And then send me the recording of this so I can send it to.

**Jon Kluger:** My va. You're gonna get a email from Firefly AI.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** And Firefly will have all of the contact.
**Jon Kluger:** Not contact.
**Jon Kluger:** It will have the link to the video.
**Jon Kluger:** Excuse me.
**Jon Kluger:** My only ask is just when I talk about Audience Lab, don't send it to the Audience Lab guide because I'm enjoying and going crazy.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** No, no, no, no.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I'm not that person.

**Jon Kluger:** I didn't think you are.
**Jon Kluger:** I just.
**Jon Kluger:** I just have to say it.
**Jon Kluger:** We have an internal running joke about him right now.
**Jon Kluger:** If we're being real, the guy who created the name Audience Lab, switch to us.
**Jon Kluger:** And he literally was like, yeah, the guy stole the name after I invented it.
**Jon Kluger:** So then we became Audience Labs and we were just cannibalizing his SEO for the first time.
**Jon Kluger:** Six months until he kicked us off.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was just like, oh, that's pretty funny.
**Jon Kluger:** And he's like, yeah, he wasn't a really nice guy.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was like, I've never met him personally.

**Jamie Trasciatti:** Yeah.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** All right, gentlemen.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Matt, John.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Pleasure meeting you.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** I appreciate your time.
**Jamie Trasciatti:** Send me that information and then we will.
