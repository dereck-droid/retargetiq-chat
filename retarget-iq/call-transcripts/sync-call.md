**Alex Ciereszko:** Grace, by the way, we lost Everfit Medical this morning.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Forgot to tell you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But it's okay because we got other stuff working.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm gonna let Sherry know and the team know.

**Grace Christine Anne Garcia-Gabuya:** Thank you, Alex.
**Grace Christine Anne Garcia-Gabuya:** That's unfortunate, but I was really trying hard to book for them.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, I got you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It wasn't your fault.
**Alex Ciereszko:** No, no.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You're doing a great job for Pure Life.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I am going to move Grace.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm going to move you over to Body Alchemy and Pure Life as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Those two are very important to retain.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You've been doing a great job with Pure Life, so I'm going to move you over to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** To Body Alchemy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll talk.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll talk with Sherry.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm going to send her a message here in a second.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then Yasmine's going to be heading out after this week here because we've.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We've had our situation with her, so.

**Grace Christine Anne Garcia-Gabuya:** Yeah, totally understand.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Today, really, Grace, we're just.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're going to get just the founders here on the call.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can hang out.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're just.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're really trying to get organized here, but we're going to need your help.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I really want to get you in tune with the support side, so you can just handle all the support along with the other Grace.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We came up with the name Cindy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I know.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Sherry was laughing about it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** She said that you'll be Cindy for now, so you'll go by Cindy, and then Grace can go by Grace, the other Grace, if that works for you.

**Grace Christine Anne Garcia-Gabuya:** Okay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**Grace Christine Anne Garcia-Gabuya:** I'll just listen to you guys.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Sounds good.
**Alex Ciereszko:** All right, Alex, Nate, the only other two things we have are those two outstanding emails, which I'm just waiting for Sammy to reply to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I might just put that in the tech chat, but it's.

**Nate Calhoun:** Dude, I love this thing that Derek built.
**Nate Calhoun:** There was a guy this morning that he was saying we offered him xyz, and I was like, no one ever offered him that.
**Nate Calhoun:** And I went in High level and checked.
**Nate Calhoun:** And we did offer him that.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Nobody ever offered you that.

**Nate Calhoun:** But we did it.
**Nate Calhoun:** We positioned the email.
**Nate Calhoun:** Gray.
**Nate Calhoun:** It was basically Cindy, and she went and checked the transcript and was like, oh, we no longer offer that, but we'll honor.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I might.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I might have sent that, Nate.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm not gonna lie.

**Nate Calhoun:** Yeah, I don't even remember.
**Nate Calhoun:** I think it was my call, to be honest.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm gonna shoot Thomas a message and check if we're still on for this.

**Nate Calhoun:** I'm gonna be dealing with the Clay St.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Do you know anything about this guy, De Heala?
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is the guy I closed.
**Alex Ciereszko:** He sent this really long email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We would like to understand whether your platform provides business leads or relevant consumer business intent data through API.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We do that, right?

**Nate Calhoun:** Yep.

**Alex Ciereszko:** In simpler terms, we want to suggest leads to our.

**Nate Calhoun:** It's not me.
**Nate Calhoun:** You want to call him?

**Alex Ciereszko:** I need to see.

**Nate Calhoun:** You want to call him?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I'm just trying to log into High Level.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I need to switch.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Switch to my account.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I might just jump in this Google Meet.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay, Grace, we might.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We might push this meeting.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Grace.

**Grace Christine Anne Garcia-Gabuya:** Okay, sure thing.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Just.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Just bear with me here for two seconds, because if I can put Klug on this, It.
