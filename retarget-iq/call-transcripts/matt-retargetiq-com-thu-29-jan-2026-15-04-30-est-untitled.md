## Transcript

**Matthew Bryce:** Have that set on for meetings you own.
**Matthew Bryce:** It should automatically join.

**Trevor Cox:** Heck yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** So if there's a meeting like that you don't own, like let's say John booked a meeting and you took over.

**Trevor Cox:** Yes.

**Matthew Bryce:** It should still join in because I think John obviously has one too.
**Matthew Bryce:** But if anything, you could just go back in and then just invite it yourself.

**Trevor Cox:** I gotcha.
**Trevor Cox:** Very cool.
**Trevor Cox:** I'm gonna actually just set that up right now because honestly, that's more of what's stressing me out with the pitch over anything is just making sure that all of my technology is working and that I can actually transition between screens smoothly and everything.
**Trevor Cox:** So.

**Matthew Bryce:** And that's why it's good that we're doing this right.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we can actually just kind of get that.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh, yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** So meetings.
**Trevor Cox:** Fireflies will join only meetings with only meetings that I own.

**Matthew Bryce:** While you set that up, I'm going to do something interesting for you.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** I'm going to role play your 6pm okay, very cool.
**Matthew Bryce:** So let me just do a little research on your 6pm quick.
**Matthew Bryce:** What's weird though is I don't see you in the Go High level calendars.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** If you go to.
**Trevor Cox:** Let's see, you have to go to the Go High level calendars and then you go Calendar View.
**Trevor Cox:** If you go to the right hand side, you'll see users and then if you see my name, you can select.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, I needed to reload.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's the problem.

**Trevor Cox:** I gotcha.

**Matthew Bryce:** There we go.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right.
**Matthew Bryce:** So yeah, so there's your 6:15 with Audrey Talkington.
**Matthew Bryce:** I mean.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, I know.
**Trevor Cox:** I'm still not convinced that it's not maybe the AI training bot or something.
**Trevor Cox:** We'll see.
**Trevor Cox:** Oh, let's see.

**Matthew Bryce:** Right there.
**Matthew Bryce:** There was a trading bot that they mentioned.

**Trevor Cox:** Yes.
**Trevor Cox:** Let's see here.
**Trevor Cox:** I'm looking up the name.

**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, marketing.
**Matthew Bryce:** Marketing@mybpx.com.
**Matthew Bryce:** let me look this up.
**Matthew Bryce:** My BPX.

**Trevor Cox:** My BPX Cloud from St. Paul.

**Matthew Bryce:** What is going on here?
**Matthew Bryce:** Why aren't you letting me type?
**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, there we go.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, let me do some research.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you want to finish setting up Fireflies real quick.

**Trevor Cox:** I got you, man.

**Matthew Bryce:** Then I'll be Audrey.

**Trevor Cox:** Sounds like a plan.

**Matthew Bryce:** Futures now.
**Matthew Bryce:** Welcome to MyBPX Cloud.
**Matthew Bryce:** Affordable, customizable, scalable entrepreneurs.
**Matthew Bryce:** AI business cloud assistant.

**Trevor Cox:** All right.

**Matthew Bryce:** It.
**Matthew Bryce:** Okay.
**Matthew Bryce:** Seems like an interesting business.
**Matthew Bryce:** This could be a good call for you.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh, yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** Heck yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** My BPX Cloud stores is your all in one AI powered business app designed to streamline operations, boost productivity and grow your revenue from smart CRM.
**Trevor Cox:** Automation and customer engagement tools to E commerce solutions and real time analytics.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yep.

**Trevor Cox:** Intriguing.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, very intriguing.
**Matthew Bryce:** This is a good one.
**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, yeah, this is definitely not the AI bot.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** Oh, yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** However, is Audrey real?
**Matthew Bryce:** We still don't know.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, very true, very true.
**Trevor Cox:** Oh, heck yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** I wonder what is her actual position at the company?

**Matthew Bryce:** That's what I was.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm trying to find her.

**Trevor Cox:** I see it on LinkedIn, but I'm not signed in, so it's not letting me actually click through her profile.

**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, she's on LinkedIn then.

**Trevor Cox:** She's the president of sales and marketing at my BPX and the COO at bridgepact.

**Matthew Bryce:** I just found her.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, Hell yeah, she's real.

**Matthew Bryce:** Audrey Tonkington.

**Trevor Cox:** Interesting.
**Trevor Cox:** And the bridgepact is an international business development AI technology company.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's pretty cool.

**Trevor Cox:** Cool.
**Trevor Cox:** Well, she's gonna know way fucking more than I do, so I'm just gonna let her and just be like, what do you want?

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, what you want we can deliver.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh, yeah, absolutely.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right.

**Trevor Cox:** Alrighty.
**Trevor Cox:** Well, would you like to pretend to.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, I'm Audrey.

**Trevor Cox:** Okay, I got you, I got you.
**Trevor Cox:** Let's see here.
**Trevor Cox:** Come on.

**Matthew Bryce:** Cool.

**Trevor Cox:** All right, so Audrey, nice to meet you today.
**Trevor Cox:** What brings you into the demo?

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, so my BPX is an AI powered cloud service and we're looking to help small businesses, even I would say from entrepreneurs to small businesses startups, kind of roll through all aspects of their business.
**Matthew Bryce:** Right.
**Matthew Bryce:** We want to be able to have them capture all their data and then leverage their data in the proper way.
**Matthew Bryce:** So whether it's for SEO, advertising, marketing, and then also to understand what's happening with that data so we could help them be more efficient and monitor their business all in a one stop shop.

**Trevor Cox:** Awesome.
**Trevor Cox:** And are you looking to manage their accounts yourself or are you looking to give them their individual licenses to run their own campaigns?

**Matthew Bryce:** You know, I think it could be either or.
**Matthew Bryce:** Because, you know, sometimes clients need that white glove service and other ones might just, you know, want to be able to take their own dashboards and kind of run with it.
**Matthew Bryce:** But, you know, in case we need to be there to help them, we need that opportunity as well.

**Trevor Cox:** Absolutely.
**Trevor Cox:** Well, we can get down to the nitty gritty here.
**Trevor Cox:** I'm going to go ahead and just demo the product for you.
**Trevor Cox:** Let me go ahead and share my screen here.
**Trevor Cox:** Let me pull up.

**Matthew Bryce:** And yet I'm very familiar with Audience Lab and I noticed your advertising and that kind of was like, brought me in.
**Matthew Bryce:** I was like, you know, Audience Lab has some pretty Good reputation.
**Matthew Bryce:** But considering that you're saying you're better, I'd like to also understand that.

**Trevor Cox:** Yes.
**Trevor Cox:** So, yeah, Audience Lab is definitely one of our main competitors.
**Trevor Cox:** We are the new kids on the block.
**Trevor Cox:** So really right now we're just trying to get really great business relationships so that we can continue to grow our company and aid in everybody else's growth as well.
**Trevor Cox:** So right now I am on the homepage of RetroTargetIQ.
**Trevor Cox:** So, to start off, we are able to identify about 40 to 70% of site visitors just from visiting the Super Pixel.
**Trevor Cox:** So that is basically unheard of across most data platforms just in the past few days here.
**Trevor Cox:** So we can go back up to two weeks, but depending on your level of intent and the buyer's window that you're looking for, you can shorten it down to like a day if you want to.
**Trevor Cox:** But this is just for the past week here.
**Trevor Cox:** This is an actual client that we have.
**Trevor Cox:** This is their United Capital Source, and this is the visitors that have been to their site in the past week right here.
**Trevor Cox:** If you're a visual learner at all, we can actually scroll down on the map and geolocate all of the pings that we have from their individual computers.
**Trevor Cox:** So if you're seeing a lot of traffic being driven around a certain area, you can use that to your advantage and actually be able to market more directly in those areas.
**Trevor Cox:** Or if you have like brick and mortar stores, advertising agencies, stuff like that, might be a good idea to throw up a branch in there.
**Trevor Cox:** But honestly, this is just a really great tool and being able to see like where your visitors are from.
**Trevor Cox:** And then above here we just have some of the sources that they came from.
**Trevor Cox:** So these are just the reroute links that they have come to our site from.
**Trevor Cox:** So next I'm going to go to the visitor identification.
**Trevor Cox:** So in this category, basically, you are going to be able to see all the information you've ever dreamed about with somebody just like enters your site.
**Trevor Cox:** So on the left we do have the name, we have email.
**Trevor Cox:** Most of the time they come with a LinkedIn URL, an address, a phone number.
**Trevor Cox:** But that's really just the basic ones.
**Trevor Cox:** We can get really down and granular with it.
**Trevor Cox:** So as you see up here, we have birthday, we have religion, we have marital status, we have financial information, we have credit score, we have homeownership, we have the phone device, meid numbers and IP addresses, we have their intents within the last week, we have their vehicles and we even have their properties.
**Trevor Cox:** So with all that data you can do so much and directly targeting basically whoever you want for any of your campaigns.
**Trevor Cox:** And if you are trying to kind of like tailor that towards smaller businesses and help them with AI, we're basically overlapping there a little bit with, you know, our data source and you having to use data for your customers, I guess.
**Trevor Cox:** So one of the cool parts that we have, I'm not too sure that this is going to be relevant to you because I'm sure that you're mostly a computer based business.
**Trevor Cox:** We do have the option for direct mail.
**Trevor Cox:** So basically you can set a campaign trigger on a pixel or a route.
**Trevor Cox:** So if I were to visit your site and then click on Contact Us and then an ad pops up and then I close out of the ad, I can use that trigger point.
**Trevor Cox:** So like when they close the ad or they went down that exact path, basically however specific you want to get with it.
**Trevor Cox:** And then once they do those actions, I can send a piece of postage out, whether it be a postcard or something, just to remind them of your product or whatever you're selling.
**Trevor Cox:** And you know, that starts at about $0.90 per piece of postage.
**Trevor Cox:** And that's like, honestly more leaning towards like real estate and you know, industries that use the physical mail a little bit more, but always an option for you.
**Trevor Cox:** So again, under the analytics tab, this is just a site breakdown showing exactly how many users were there, how many were identified and the date.
**Trevor Cox:** These are the paths that went down.
**Trevor Cox:** You can go ahead and follow those if you'd like.
**Trevor Cox:** But more so what I'm assuming that you're going to be interested in is actually the creation of audiences.
**Trevor Cox:** So main thing that sets us apart with audience lab, one, our data is superior, like by far.
**Trevor Cox:** Two, we're cheaper in 99.9% of scenarios.
**Trevor Cox:** And three, you have unlimited searches for intent.
**Trevor Cox:** You have unlimited opportunities to edit that.
**Trevor Cox:** So like we like to think of it kind of like the scientific, like if you, if you have a hypothesis, it's good to test that.
**Trevor Cox:** So what you can do is you can set up an intent category and you can say, okay, I am interested in, let's say AI.
**Trevor Cox:** Well, let's go to machine.

**Matthew Bryce:** How about cloud services?

**Trevor Cox:** Cloud services.
**Trevor Cox:** That is very weird.
**Trevor Cox:** I feel like we should have some of this.

**Matthew Bryce:** Maybe ask John.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, I can look up Alex saying something like that.

**Matthew Bryce:** They might be able to add something really quickly.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yes, I see code.
**Matthew Bryce:** So if you could have that added, that could be pretty.

**Trevor Cox:** Let's do software development, I guess.
**Trevor Cox:** Let's see here.

**Matthew Bryce:** I think that Was a good, good shift there.

**Trevor Cox:** Heck yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** Let's see here.
**Trevor Cox:** So yeah, let's go ahead and do software development.
**Trevor Cox:** Kind of basically the same space to a degree.
**Trevor Cox:** But what we can do here is we can actually go ahead and add a few things here.
**Trevor Cox:** So we're going to go ahead and set it in your state.
**Trevor Cox:** So we're going to do Minneapolis here, which is Minnesota, which I think is mi.
**Trevor Cox:** I'd have to look, to be honest with you.

**Matthew Bryce:** Mn, actually.

**Trevor Cox:** Mn.
**Trevor Cox:** Okay.
**Trevor Cox:** There we go.
**Trevor Cox:** Yes, that's Michigan.
**Trevor Cox:** There we go.
**Trevor Cox:** Awesome.

**Matthew Bryce:** Just as cold.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** And then let's go ahead and see here.
**Trevor Cox:** Well, if we're looking, let's go ahead and just do.
**Trevor Cox:** We'll add the LinkedIn URL.
**Trevor Cox:** We're just going to put that as to has value.
**Trevor Cox:** The only reason that we really do that, we found that with the LinkedIn URL, it does tend to give us like slight, slightly better data sets because if somebody has that LinkedIn URL information, we can find out their employee history, what they do for work, general net worth.
**Trevor Cox:** So that is one of those things that just a little trick if you're looking to kind of like find like the peak audience.
**Trevor Cox:** But anyways, once you're at this page here, it's as simple as pie.
**Trevor Cox:** Basically, just go ahead and wait a few minutes.
**Trevor Cox:** It says that it might take 15 to 20 minutes.
**Trevor Cox:** We just say that so that people don't freak out and expect every bit to be done within two seconds.
**Trevor Cox:** But we like to say just check your email, take that phone call, maybe go pet your dog for a second.
**Trevor Cox:** And then once you get back, go ahead and click refresh and boom, your report is ready.
**Trevor Cox:** So we were able to pull 2550 and these are the site visitors that meet our criteria with the intent.
**Trevor Cox:** So let me go back there.
**Trevor Cox:** Very cool.
**Trevor Cox:** So as I said, we have the name, we have the email, we have the phone number, we have their address because I did put in the LinkedIn that has a value.
**Trevor Cox:** We do also have that information for all of these.
**Trevor Cox:** But we can go through here and we can see the intent score.
**Trevor Cox:** So we have low, medium and high.
**Trevor Cox:** And I do want to say that even for our lowest intent, that's not like they just clicked on an ad one time and walked away.
**Trevor Cox:** Generally speaking, it's three different points.
**Trevor Cox:** So they would have had to click an ad, visit the website, browse a little bit, do their own search based on the same topic.
**Trevor Cox:** So it's not just going to happen like if you hand your iPad off to your kid for five minutes and then he's looking up something on YouTube that's not going to be in the intent category for us.
**Trevor Cox:** We are able to separate that out, thankfully, which is able to, you know, give you a little bit better data on all the individuals that you have listed here.
**Trevor Cox:** But yeah, if you want to just target the lows, the mediums, either way, it's going to be a pretty good bet that these people have been looking for software in the past couple of weeks here.
**Trevor Cox:** So boom, boom, let's go down here.
**Trevor Cox:** So we do have multiple integrations.
**Trevor Cox:** So our current CRM is high level or go high level, but we work with numerous others.
**Trevor Cox:** You can export all these CSV data, you can go ahead and use your own API, but we have HubSpot, we have Go high level connector, we have the Meta connector.
**Trevor Cox:** One thing that I really want to point out there is that the FHA 256, we actually have about a 90% match rate when we cross reference our data with them.
**Trevor Cox:** So we have been able to kind of figure out that like maze, that is metadata and we can use that for a very, very strong Facebook campaign.
**Trevor Cox:** Google Ads, Connector, Salesforce, Klaviyo.
**Trevor Cox:** That's going to be more of your email and we even have some more here on the second page.
**Trevor Cox:** So Beehive, pipedrive, Slack, mailchimp, and basically the only other thing that I have is, or the only other thing that I wanted to ask you is do you have any questions about anything or any of our services before I get into a pricing breakdown?

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, I'd love to understand why your data is better than Audience Lab.
**Matthew Bryce:** Because for what we're building, we want to make sure that we have the best data that we can afford to also help anybody that's using our product to obviously build the best business that they can.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** Basically we have one major data source, which is the big guy in the game.
**Trevor Cox:** Unfortunately I can't say exactly what it is, but if you're familiar, it's a large global company and Otherwise we have 209 approximate other sources of data that waterfall enrich.
**Trevor Cox:** So we are cross referencing multiple times for every data set we have access to the largest data set.
**Trevor Cox:** You know, if you were going to access this in any other form, it would cost way more money, like we're talking 10, 20 times more, like hundreds of thousands of dollars a month to get access to this specific data set.
**Trevor Cox:** So we were able to kind of finagle a deal and we have access to that and with different, you know, licensing agreements, we are able to pass that on to you.
**Trevor Cox:** And the best part is if you're interested in the white label program, we can actually go ahead and give you 10 licenses up front.
**Trevor Cox:** If you have additional licenses that you'd like to pass on, you can do that for just $100 a piece after that 10, that initial 10.
**Trevor Cox:** So if you have 20 clients that you're looking and they're looking to use their own CRM or if you want to brand our CRM for this purpose, you can and you can sell it to them for $500 to $1000 per license.
**Trevor Cox:** If you do that for about four or five licenses over that 10, 10, not just the number 10 over 10, then you will actually pay for the whole subscription itself.
**Trevor Cox:** So you have the potential to not only save money, but you can actually make money off our data.
**Trevor Cox:** So that's going to really set us apart.
**Trevor Cox:** And the other thing is that we literally have no caps.
**Trevor Cox:** So there is no limit to how many site visitors we can identify.
**Trevor Cox:** There is no limit to how many intents like you can search and identify and run campaigns based off of.
**Trevor Cox:** We are giving you untethered access to all of this data.
**Trevor Cox:** And really right now it's the best deal it's going to be ever.
**Trevor Cox:** We are young, we just started out within the next month.
**Trevor Cox:** So February 15th we are upping the price.
**Trevor Cox:** We are coming out with version two.
**Trevor Cox:** It's just basically going to be the same thing but a lot sexier.
**Trevor Cox:** We're going to fix a few little bugs here and there, but the UI UX experience is just going to be phenomenal.
**Trevor Cox:** So it's going to be a much easier time for you.
**Trevor Cox:** We do offer a Slack library of videos as well.
**Trevor Cox:** So if you do need any extra help, we offer that.
**Trevor Cox:** Now if you are somebody that struggles with technology and it's not really your thing, but you still want to go ahead and learn it all.
**Trevor Cox:** We do also offer a white glove service.
**Trevor Cox:** Now that is about $275 a month.
**Trevor Cox:** And what that guarantees is just that we will get on the phone with you within 24 hours and book a one on one meeting to go over your problems or any issues that you may have with the software or if you're just wanting to learn how to do something.
**Trevor Cox:** But I really don't think that 99% of my clients in this space really need it.
**Trevor Cox:** They are coming to me with knowledge of data and marketing and how all of these things already work.
**Trevor Cox:** They're familiar with audience labs go high level, but we do just offer it just in case.
**Trevor Cox:** But if you were looking for that single license, and this would give you the right to manage.
**Trevor Cox:** So, like, you could, you know, run all the things for, you know, the ad campaigns for companies underneath you if you don't want to give them access to their own license, but then again, they wouldn't have access to that themselves, if that makes sense.
**Trevor Cox:** You could run it for them, but it's a little trickier.
**Trevor Cox:** And that's going to start.
**Trevor Cox:** It's going to be $500 quarterly.
**Trevor Cox:** We always recommend doing the quarterly price.
**Trevor Cox:** It's $500 for three months, $1,500.
**Trevor Cox:** It's so much cheaper than audience labs.
**Trevor Cox:** It's not funny.
**Trevor Cox:** But if you're really just looking to test the waters, unfortunately I can't give you a demo as that does break data guidelines.
**Trevor Cox:** But we could give you the monthly subscription.
**Trevor Cox:** It's going to be $750.
**Trevor Cox:** And if you want to be grandfathered in, what you can do is just say after a week of using it and getting used to everything, you can say, hey, Trevor, please, I'd love to sign on for the quarterly or the annual, and I can go ahead and one grandfather you into the pricing that you see on the computer here.
**Trevor Cox:** So if in the next week or so you do want to sign up for more, you'll get that $500 for the or 417 for the annual.
**Trevor Cox:** When V2 comes out, that price will not raise.
**Trevor Cox:** Six months from now, when we raise our prices again, that price will not raise.
**Trevor Cox:** So it's really the time to get in here for like the best bang for your buck and.
**Trevor Cox:** Yep.
**Trevor Cox:** So if you have any questions about that, just kind of let me know here and I can go ahead and follow up.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.
**Matthew Bryce:** So I can pretty much have uncapped, unlimited amounts of data when it comes to the audience, the enrichment or intent.
**Matthew Bryce:** And.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I can either provide that for my clients or I can go white label and actually give them access to it.
**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, I think I lost you, Trevor.
**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, we lost them.

**Trevor Cox:** All right.
**Trevor Cox:** There we go.
**Trevor Cox:** Not sure what happened there.

**Matthew Bryce:** No.
**Matthew Bryce:** So I guess the question I have is because, you know, I understand it all and want to make sure that we're really giving the client, our clients, the best data possible.
**Matthew Bryce:** So you're saying that for those prices, if I were to sign up today, let's just say I wanted to test out for a month just to kind of make sure that it is exactly what I'm looking for and exactly what you're saying.
**Matthew Bryce:** Which is unlimited audience, unlimited intent, unlimited search, unlimited enrichment, and being able to plug it into what I'm building and then it all works out, I get that upgrade further.
**Matthew Bryce:** I just need to make that decision.
**Matthew Bryce:** Before the 15th?

**Trevor Cox:** Yes.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, before the 15th.
**Trevor Cox:** So that is when prices are going to raise here.
**Trevor Cox:** But it's.
**Trevor Cox:** It will raise, but it's not going to be crazy substantial.
**Trevor Cox:** I would highly recommend that if you are seriously interested or have worked in the space with Audience Labs, just go ahead and give us a try.
**Trevor Cox:** I mean, you're not going to be spending any more money.
**Trevor Cox:** It's definitely worth it.
**Trevor Cox:** And like I said, yeah, on the 15th, it looks like that price is going to raise to about $1,000 a month and then about 750 for the quarterly.
**Trevor Cox:** So basically it's just going to be going up about a tier.
**Trevor Cox:** So if it was 750 monthly, it's going to be 750 quarterly.
**Trevor Cox:** So definitely recommend it.
**Trevor Cox:** You know, and as I build up.

**Matthew Bryce:** Clients, like, let's just say, you know, I start off, I have, you know, because we're currently.
**Matthew Bryce:** Right now I have about 10 clients that are using this and let's say, you know, I slowly sign on and get 10 or 20 more and I want to be the one to handle it.
**Matthew Bryce:** I could easily just add pixels on.

**Trevor Cox:** Yep.
**Trevor Cox:** So each additional pixel.
**Trevor Cox:** So I can go ahead and pull up the breakdown one more time for you because this is the only part that gets a little confusing for me.
**Trevor Cox:** So give me just one second here.
**Trevor Cox:** Computer is having a great time.
**Trevor Cox:** So.
**Trevor Cox:** All right, so if we go here to the Variables tab and we go to Pixel bulk pricing.
**Trevor Cox:** So if you are somebody that needs to have access to, you know, say 50, 100, 100 plus pixels, what we can do is we can bring the cost of that down, you know, the more that you buy, basically.
**Trevor Cox:** So we do have a Pixel bulk pricing deal.
**Trevor Cox:** So 0 through 25, it's just going to be an additional $50 per month.
**Trevor Cox:** 26 through 50, 45, 51 through 140.
**Trevor Cox:** If you have over 100 pixels, we're only going to charge you $35 a month for those individual pixels, which does make us quite a bit more affordable.
**Trevor Cox:** And the pay is upfront.
**Trevor Cox:** So we're not coming up to you after you already have agreed to things and then you might have clicked a few buttons and you didn't realize that you were going over your limit.
**Trevor Cox:** There is no limit except for the number of pixels that you have.
**Trevor Cox:** And you can always buy more for like, very Reasonably priced.
**Trevor Cox:** So.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** How do I pay?

**Trevor Cox:** What'd you say?

**Matthew Bryce:** I said, how do I pay?

**Trevor Cox:** How do you pay?
**Trevor Cox:** Let me go ahead and send that over to you right now.
**Trevor Cox:** I can actually send it over to you though.
**Trevor Cox:** Here, let me do that.
**Trevor Cox:** I just got this from Alex.
**Trevor Cox:** I'm going to have to type it out.
**Trevor Cox:** This painting.

**Matthew Bryce:** So the same.
**Matthew Bryce:** Did he mention if it's.
**Matthew Bryce:** If it's the same URL it is.

**Trevor Cox:** So I said, could you send me the payment link portal when you get the chance?
**Trevor Cox:** And he said yes.
**Trevor Cox:** And he said can email this as well and then just only sent me one link.
**Trevor Cox:** So I'm going to go ahead and just send you the link that he sent me.
**Trevor Cox:** And I'm assuming This is the 1D.

**Matthew Bryce:** I have an idea.
**Matthew Bryce:** Quickly.
**Matthew Bryce:** Where is my fireflies?
**Matthew Bryce:** Where was it?
**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, here it is.
**Matthew Bryce:** Is this it by any chance?

**Trevor Cox:** That looks a lot like it, but this is.
**Trevor Cox:** That's not the one that he sent me, so I'm sure.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay.
**Matthew Bryce:** So I wonder if maybe will each salesperson has their own link.
**Matthew Bryce:** Maybe.

**Trevor Cox:** I don't know.
**Trevor Cox:** Because it looks like this is not really.
**Trevor Cox:** Like this is something that you email them, I guess.
**Trevor Cox:** And that's why I'm confused because it's also.
**Trevor Cox:** It's a.
**Trevor Cox:** It looks like it's a Google Doc, so.
**Trevor Cox:** Oh, not really sure how it works.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, last thing, you know, the last thing I'd want is to give somebody else somebody else's payment link.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know what I mean?
**Matthew Bryce:** Like have like a payment go to.
**Matthew Bryce:** Like, that's my biggest worry is if I were to share a payment link with somebody, it's like, is that.
**Matthew Bryce:** Will that get tied to somebody else's account versus like their own account?
**Matthew Bryce:** You know what I mean?
**Matthew Bryce:** Like in case everything's individualized.
**Matthew Bryce:** But okay.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, it looks like.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, stripe is definitely.
**Trevor Cox:** That is a good link to have.
**Trevor Cox:** The one that I sent you doesn't even say that it exists.
**Trevor Cox:** So yeah, I'm going to try and pull it up on my phone and see what the issue is with that.
**Trevor Cox:** Okay, cool.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, I'll just send this to you over text here real quick so you can.
**Trevor Cox:** And that just seems to have a breakdown of all the different prices and their specific links.
**Trevor Cox:** So it looks like there are specific links for each package.
**Trevor Cox:** So if somebody does monthly versus quarterly versus whatever.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's what it is.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right.
**Matthew Bryce:** So yeah, so the one that I had sent was the ggof, which is the quarterly plan.
**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, perfect.
**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, now I wonder, VIP support.
**Matthew Bryce:** Like, do you use that link for everything or if they wanted the VIP support, you have to give them that link.

**Trevor Cox:** I think that's just for V. Oh, never mind.

**Matthew Bryce:** I see a combined pricing below.
**Matthew Bryce:** Monthly with VIP support, monthly with API access, monthly with vip, and API back quarterly with.
**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, perfect.

**Trevor Cox:** Cool, cool.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, good.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right.
**Matthew Bryce:** This is great.
**Matthew Bryce:** Thank you.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, of course, man.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, let me quickly do this.
**Matthew Bryce:** Paste you.

**Trevor Cox:** Boom.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, there we go.
**Matthew Bryce:** Perfect.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I have that open up as another tab just in case of anything.

**Trevor Cox:** Awesome.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, awesome.

**Matthew Bryce:** That was a good.
**Matthew Bryce:** That.
**Matthew Bryce:** That was solid for sure.
**Matthew Bryce:** Cool.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, I'm definitely gonna have to just push through it, especially with people that seem like they are gonna know a lot more than even me.
**Trevor Cox:** So.

**Matthew Bryce:** I would imagine that she probably, you know, knows all about advertising and how to connect those dots.
**Matthew Bryce:** So it's really, just really ensuring her that the data that we're providing her is the best.
**Matthew Bryce:** And like you said, you are like, unlimited, you know, being capable of the audience, the enrichment, the intent, like, all of that type of stuff, I think, is that being unlimited uncapped is hopefully what will be the major selling point.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh, yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** Oh, yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** And I'm sure.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I'm sure thinking that she would probably also want the API access, whether she does white label or not.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm sure she wants the API access.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** Because I would imagine she wants to connect her.
**Matthew Bryce:** My, you know, the.
**Matthew Bryce:** My BPX platform into Retarget IQ into our platform.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right.

**Trevor Cox:** There.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** I'm gonna see what she wants, but I'm really gonna try and push for a white label.
**Trevor Cox:** Hopefully.
**Trevor Cox:** We'll see.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Matthew Bryce:** I mean, I would imagine she would want a white label.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** What she does, it sounds like she would, but, you know, not.
**Trevor Cox:** Not positive.
**Trevor Cox:** So we'll see.

**Matthew Bryce:** It also depends on how many clients they have.
**Matthew Bryce:** Like, are they brand new and they only have two clients?
**Matthew Bryce:** Maybe they don't want the white label yet.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's something they might graduate into.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know, I mean, that has definitely.

**Trevor Cox:** Been common on some of the calls I've been shadowing so far.
**Trevor Cox:** It's like people, they want the white label, but then they'll be like, oh, I only have like four.
**Trevor Cox:** Can I just do four?
**Trevor Cox:** And we keep that and we're like, oh, like, kind of.
**Trevor Cox:** But like, not the white label then.
**Trevor Cox:** No.
**Trevor Cox:** You know, so, yeah, definitely going to be interesting.
**Trevor Cox:** Did you want to run through one real quick or.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** Cool.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** So share.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right.
**Matthew Bryce:** Hey, Trevor, how you doing today?
**Matthew Bryce:** Good.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, so I'M guessing that you saw our ad on Facebook about us being better than Audience Lab and that's what brings you here.

**Trevor Cox:** It is, yes.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's pretty awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** How familiar are you with Audience Lab?

**Trevor Cox:** So I use Audience Labs here for the past few months.
**Trevor Cox:** You know, I've been decently happy with their services, but I still feel like I'm kind of limited to how many, you know, searches I can actually complete and some, some issues with the contacts over there.
**Trevor Cox:** I didn't really have anybody demo like this, so I appreciate you taking the time to show me.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's great because that's, it seems like you're, you're definitely being, you know, a very common theme that we see is people are, feel like they're limited with audience lag.
**Matthew Bryce:** As we get a little bit deeper into this, I'm going to show you why we're better than them.
**Matthew Bryce:** Outside of just from the data perspective, is there anything else that you're unhappy with outside of, you know, seems like you don't get a great response and you feel that you're limited.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.

**Trevor Cox:** So basically I run a marketing agency so I do a lot of my own, like drip campaigns.
**Trevor Cox:** I've been marketing on, you know, Facebook or Meta for the past five, seven years now.
**Trevor Cox:** I also use Google Analytics and Google Data as well.
**Trevor Cox:** I just feel like I have not been able to secure the leads that have been promised to me.
**Trevor Cox:** So like every time I hear one of these things they say it's basically too good to be true.
**Trevor Cox:** I'm going to get, you know, this perfect list of people that I can go ahead, pick up the phone call and they're all going to go ahead and sign on with me.
**Trevor Cox:** And what I found is that a lot of the data that I've been using is old, it's been recycled.
**Trevor Cox:** So like, you know, they're saying that it's up to date with their addresses and their emails, but then, you know, it goes completely cold and if I do reach out to them, it's, it's not the same person.
**Trevor Cox:** So I'm really looking for an up to date data set that, you know, actually does provide what they say they provide.

**Matthew Bryce:** That's awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** Well, I'm Matt.
**Matthew Bryce:** I am going to be your representative.
**Matthew Bryce:** So feel free to always reach out to me if you have any questions or you need anything.
**Matthew Bryce:** But let's get into the meat of what this all is.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now I did hear you say that everybody promises you the world, but nobody can deliver.
**Matthew Bryce:** So I'm not going to promise you the world, but What I am going to do is I'm going to deliver on what I'm going to promise you.
**Matthew Bryce:** And that is amazing data that is untethered and uncapped.
**Matthew Bryce:** So what you feel you're limited on, I don't want you to feel limited.
**Matthew Bryce:** I know I can deliver on that.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I say that because we, every single client of ours is able to do anything that they need in our platform using our data, and we never stop them.
**Matthew Bryce:** And the reason why is because we believe data is the power of everything that people need.
**Matthew Bryce:** So when you're cap and you're limited to it, your hands are tied.
**Matthew Bryce:** And we don't want your hands to be tied by your data.
**Matthew Bryce:** We want you to be the most powerful that you can be.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we want to give you the best data that we can and make you the most powerful.
**Matthew Bryce:** So with that said, this is, this is our dashboard.
**Matthew Bryce:** United Capital Source is a loan company and this is, and this is actually their dashboard that they see.
**Matthew Bryce:** They've given us approval to kind of show you exactly what it is that, that that they're seeing because we want to give you a real time view.
**Matthew Bryce:** And this real time view shows that in the past week They've had almost 10,000 people reach their website.
**Matthew Bryce:** Of that we've been able to identify up to about 50% of them.
**Matthew Bryce:** And we know exactly where they're coming from, their top pages, their top sources, and what cities they're coming from.
**Matthew Bryce:** So if we scroll down a little bit, kind of scroll down a little bit too prematurely, but if we now zoom in instead of zoom out because we're in the US and not in on the other side of the world, you are getting the heat map of everywhere that people are coming to the United Capital Source website.
**Matthew Bryce:** So whether it's in the Ohio range, I keep zooming out because I'm still learning, Max.
**Matthew Bryce:** So please forgive me.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you go over here to the Chicago area, they have a bunch of, a bunch of hits that are coming into their website.
**Matthew Bryce:** They're coming organically from Google or even from ads like Taboola.
**Matthew Bryce:** And we're able to identify them.
**Matthew Bryce:** We know who they are, where they're coming from, their address, their phone numbers, the path that they, again, the path that they took to get here.
**Matthew Bryce:** And here's a beauty of all this data.
**Matthew Bryce:** We can give basic information, address information.
**Matthew Bryce:** We know all of their phone numbers, the devices that they're using, their IP addresses, their behavioral statuses, so any type of behavioral indexes that, that they have or that they enjoy because of what they're doing on the Internet, we're able to kind of group that in and we know exactly what they're doing.

**Trevor Cox:** Nice.

**Matthew Bryce:** Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
**Matthew Bryce:** To me it's a great.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** From a consumer standpoint, maybe I don't want somebody to know exactly who I am and what I'm doing.
**Matthew Bryce:** But for all purposes here, we want to make sure that you see the power of that.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now is that similar to Audience Lab?
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm not going to say yes or no, but what I am going to say is I'm going to show you why we're so powerful.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now we get this data from one of the biggest and best data companies in the country.
**Matthew Bryce:** Then we take that and we Waterfall another 209 sources through that data source to make sure that we are enriching as much as possible to give you all the data that you see here.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now you mentioned the trip campaign.
**Matthew Bryce:** Well, guess what, we have direct access to direct mail so you can easily set up some campaign triggers in order to see if somebody comes to your website.
**Matthew Bryce:** You can follow up with certain frequency every seven days or 30 days.
**Matthew Bryce:** But the beauty of it all is, is that you can ever you can leverage that drip campaign right through direct mail.
**Matthew Bryce:** So if they've come to your website, you know they're here, why didn't they convert?
**Matthew Bryce:** Let's try to get them to convert.
**Matthew Bryce:** What's another way to get them to convert outside of retargeting them on the Internet but making sure that they see it when they come home and they get their mail from their mailbox.
**Matthew Bryce:** Let's go into the analytics a little deeper.
**Matthew Bryce:** Dive into the analytics so we could see what their income ranges are.
**Matthew Bryce:** And considering that the United Capital Source is a loan company, I'm not surprised that their income source is 0 to 99k.
**Matthew Bryce:** Right.
**Matthew Bryce:** People that are on the lower income side probably would need a loan to maybe fix something in their house.
**Matthew Bryce:** We know their audience by age.
**Matthew Bryce:** They're 50 plus the majority of them.
**Matthew Bryce:** Again, make sense for people that need loans.
**Matthew Bryce:** Right.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know your water heater breaks, it's going to be 10, 20 grand.
**Matthew Bryce:** You might need to get a HELOC.
**Matthew Bryce:** So this all makes sense and as you can see, it's all powered by our data.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now let's get into the meat of everything here, the audiences.
**Matthew Bryce:** This is what really excites me about this platform and why I've recently joined the team.
**Matthew Bryce:** We can create an audience so you can search based on like a demographic or details, income, job, Roles, education, history.
**Matthew Bryce:** We can easily do any type of search just like you would anywhere else.
**Matthew Bryce:** But let's get a little deeper than that.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I say, or we say intent is the best way to do that.
**Matthew Bryce:** Why intent?
**Matthew Bryce:** Because we know that it's something that people are searching for.
**Matthew Bryce:** We know that they're actively looking on the Internet for something and we want to make sure that we hit them when they are, are literally in that buying cycle.
**Matthew Bryce:** That buying cycle generally takes two weeks.
**Matthew Bryce:** So that's where our data is.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know, you can go further back if you want, but you probably missed the window in that buying cycle.
**Matthew Bryce:** So let's leverage the best data in that best time frame.
**Matthew Bryce:** So I'm going to open her up for two weeks.
**Matthew Bryce:** So the topic here, you said that remind me exactly what your business is again.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, so I do marketing campaigns.
**Trevor Cox:** So yeah, we can do, let's do marketing as a term.
**Trevor Cox:** We're doing B2C.
**Trevor Cox:** So yeah, we'll do marketing.

**Matthew Bryce:** And so we could do overall marketing.
**Matthew Bryce:** We could do faith based marketing, social media marketing, manufacturer marketing.
**Matthew Bryce:** So as you can see, we have a bunch of different code of really diving into outside of just marketing for these purposes.
**Matthew Bryce:** Let's just say we want to cast a wide net as you said, marketing.
**Matthew Bryce:** Let's just hit marketing overall.
**Matthew Bryce:** So anybody that's in the topic of marketing.

**Trevor Cox:** Cool, cool.

**Matthew Bryce:** We're going to add some rules to this to really hone in on exactly what it is that.
**Matthew Bryce:** Sorry, exactly what the type of high value target is that you're looking for within that marketing space.
**Matthew Bryce:** So what's something that's very important to you?
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm going to add a couple of things here that I think is important because we want to make sure that we have it.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we're going to add an email as value.
**Matthew Bryce:** What else is, is there anything else that you.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's really important to you?

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, you know, I would like.
**Trevor Cox:** Are we able to sort by income?

**Matthew Bryce:** By income?
**Matthew Bryce:** I think we can sort by income.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now you're going to see while I find the income here, I added in LinkedIn.
**Matthew Bryce:** We like to add in LinkedIn because it gives that extra piece of, it gives that extra, that extra touch in their online history to make sure that who we're getting again is that high value target.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's going to be somebody that's really at that, at that core buying cycle.
**Matthew Bryce:** High value target.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's going to, That's going to convert for you.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, you want high income.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** So let's do anything above like 150,000 basically.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, that's what I like to hear.
**Matthew Bryce:** We want some really high net individuals.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh yeah, great.

**Matthew Bryce:** And that's why we also want to add that LinkedIn source.
**Matthew Bryce:** Right.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now adding in LinkedIn with the ink, with the high, with, with the high income really is really going to pull back that there's really pull in the data that's going to be able to show people that are, are isolated to just where exactly what it is that you're looking for.
**Matthew Bryce:** Since you're looking for those high value people, I think there is one other code here that I just want to take a look at net worth.
**Matthew Bryce:** Since you want the high value people, let's also make sure that they are exactly high value.
**Matthew Bryce:** So not only do they have income of 150,000, but let's make sure they at least have $100,000 or more.

**Trevor Cox:** Perfect.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, now we're gonna hit build audience.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now that's the beauty of our, of this tool, right?
**Matthew Bryce:** You're able to really hone in on a specific audience that's going to give you, that's going to give you high intent purchasers, people that are ready to make a type of purchase.
**Matthew Bryce:** You're getting them early in the buying cycle and you're going to be able to leverage this, this data to make sure that you're advertising towards them.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now it's going to say that it's going to take 15 to 20 minutes.
**Matthew Bryce:** But generally I'm sure after that quick segue that I just mentioned, it's already done.
**Matthew Bryce:** So at any point in time you can easily just check your phone, check your email, you know, stand up, stretch your legs, hit the refresh button.
**Matthew Bryce:** It's going to be there, we say 10 to 15 minutes just because, you know, in case you pull a really big data set, it might take a little bit longer rather than if it just took two seconds.
**Matthew Bryce:** You hit refreshments, not ready.
**Matthew Bryce:** And now you're going to get, you know, you might get a little mad or some people get a little anxious, but either way, we've pulled in the past two weeks, we have almost 100,000 people in our audience set here that meet that criteria.
**Matthew Bryce:** Again, they are high value, high intent early in the buying cycle, consumers ready to make their purchase.
**Matthew Bryce:** And we have their phone numbers, we made sure they have an email address just in case of anything.
**Matthew Bryce:** Right now you're going to get the phone number now.
**Matthew Bryce:** But here's the key is I didn't say phone number when we were doing it, when we were setting up the query.
**Matthew Bryce:** So you're going to have some that are missing.
**Matthew Bryce:** So if you really want to make cold calls, which sometimes we don't exactly recommend just because we don't know.
**Matthew Bryce:** Think about yourself.
**Matthew Bryce:** You get a cold call, sometimes you're a little less likely to answer the phone, but at least you have their email, which is why I always go back to email.
**Matthew Bryce:** And we know that they are, they have good jobs.
**Matthew Bryce:** Managing partner, co founder, board member.
**Matthew Bryce:** So you're getting these high value targets here with high, with high net worth and high income.
**Matthew Bryce:** Nice.
**Matthew Bryce:** Really cool thing that I, that I love about this is if you hit download wrong one, if you hit download all you're going to be able to name it.
**Matthew Bryce:** You're going to say my network individual can't spell right now.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we're just going to put that individuals that we're going to look to target and remember how I told you that it's two weeks.
**Matthew Bryce:** Well, here's the best part.
**Matthew Bryce:** Tomorrow you could run this and you could schedule this to run tomorrow.
**Matthew Bryce:** Today's data.
**Matthew Bryce:** Tomorrow.
**Matthew Bryce:** Very cool.
**Matthew Bryce:** Sorry.
**Matthew Bryce:** Pull tomorrow's data.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, you could schedule it to continuously.
**Matthew Bryce:** Always refresh that data.
**Matthew Bryce:** And here's the beauty of it all.
**Matthew Bryce:** Just like I mentioned before, I can promise you that there are no caps.
**Matthew Bryce:** You can run this every single day.
**Matthew Bryce:** You can run it twice a day if you really wanted to.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're never going to stop.
**Matthew Bryce:** You can be hammering it away.
**Matthew Bryce:** And that's what I promised you.
**Matthew Bryce:** And you can, and also too you can have this to run on a schedule and send directly to an ad account.
**Matthew Bryce:** So you mentioned that you really enjoy Meta and Facebook ads.
**Matthew Bryce:** You also mentioned Google Ads.
**Matthew Bryce:** You could have it sent directly to there.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now you're supplying some of the biggest, best search engines in the world with the best data in the world.

**Trevor Cox:** Hell yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** Any questions so far?

**Trevor Cox:** No, it seems pretty straightforward.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, so now we're going to dive into the integrations.
**Matthew Bryce:** Here's where we have integrations with.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're happy to also try to make some integrations.
**Matthew Bryce:** You could also download CSV files and upload that into CRM Manager that we might not have the integration with.
**Matthew Bryce:** But also to let us know if there is, you know, if, if, if there is something missing that you'd like to have added.
**Matthew Bryce:** We can try to figure that out, which we'll get to shortly.
**Matthew Bryce:** By the way, we integrate with HubSpot, go high level which we use ourselves.
**Matthew Bryce:** The Meta connector, Salesforce connector.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm going to quickly show you one quick thing since we mentioned the Meta connector which is great.
**Matthew Bryce:** Switching over to this tab.
**Matthew Bryce:** So this is exactly what the report looks like when you pull it.
**Matthew Bryce:** Again, all that information, this is just a sample report.
**Matthew Bryce:** It's not the one that we just pulled to sample report, but it's going to show you everything that we just pulled, which is amazing.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now you can take that data and you can use it as, as needed.
**Matthew Bryce:** The beauty of it all is it also supplies the SHA256 code.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now if you are connecting to Meta and you are connecting to Facebook, every habit and every thing that Facebook and Meta has been tracking on any individual that's here, you're tapping into with this data.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now you just broke through the walled garden of Meta and we can also do with Google as well.
**Matthew Bryce:** But this is important for Meta because Meta has been tracking people for thought that was how long they know you better than you know.
**Matthew Bryce:** You're using our data and you're marrying it with their data and you're just going to make it even better and even deeper.
**Matthew Bryce:** And their AI tool, Andromeda, is then going to take anybody that actually converts and it's.
**Matthew Bryce:** And it's going to.
**Matthew Bryce:** And it's going to then make the lookalike model automatically happen based on the data that you're feeding them to continuously give you those high value targets outside of a data set that you see here.

**Trevor Cox:** Very cool.

**Matthew Bryce:** Any questions?

**Trevor Cox:** No?

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, so now I'm going to get into the pricing just for that, that you know, that that may be what you're thinking about.
**Matthew Bryce:** I can see that you have it in your eyes.
**Matthew Bryce:** You're like, this is pretty cool.
**Matthew Bryce:** But like I said, we do pride ourselves on not just saying that we're better than Audience Lab, but that we are delivering on that.
**Matthew Bryce:** That said, we are cheaper than Audience Lab.
**Matthew Bryce:** I don't like the word cheaper.
**Matthew Bryce:** We are more cost efficient than Audience Lab for what we're providing you.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** So with that cost efficiency, if you wanted a single license for a monthly, it's going to be $750.
**Matthew Bryce:** You do quarterly, it's $500 per month, $1500 for the three months.
**Matthew Bryce:** So basically buy two months, get one free.
**Matthew Bryce:** Or we can look at it from an annual perspective and that's $417 a month.
**Matthew Bryce:** We are coming out with our V2 version on February 15th and that is going to be a more robust platform.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're going to remove the web hooks that we have in order to get your data plugged into any type of websites and where it's going to be a Little bit more seamless.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we are raising the costs with that.
**Matthew Bryce:** But if you buy within the next week or you sign up within the next week, we guarantee you the pricing that you're at in perpetuity.
**Matthew Bryce:** Nice.

**Trevor Cox:** Very cool.

**Matthew Bryce:** So you get unlimited audiences, unlimited enrichment, unlimited intent data, all to power your marketing agency.
**Matthew Bryce:** With the single license, you get five super pixels included.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you want to add more, we can, and it's just going to be $50 additional.
**Matthew Bryce:** So that's where we can't give you unlimited on, you know, because there is a little bit extra that we have to do on our end outside of the data.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know, we do need to charge a little bit for that.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you want the API access, in case you want to plug in any other tools that you have, it would just be $297 a month.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you want White glove service.
**Matthew Bryce:** But it seems like you kind of know what you're doing, and I don't advise it unless you really, really need it.
**Matthew Bryce:** We could always add it on later.
**Matthew Bryce:** That would be another 297.
**Matthew Bryce:** But again, let's not even worry about that.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you're.
**Matthew Bryce:** Are you interested in white label at all or is this something that you're just going to be using for your clients?

**Trevor Cox:** For the time being, I think I'm just going to be using it and, you know, pushing some of the information to my clients, but I don't think any of them are going to need their license quite yet.

**Matthew Bryce:** Perfect.
**Matthew Bryce:** And if they ever do.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're talking to you about white label, and I can't guarantee anything, but, you know, signed up with us for a few quarters and you need to upgrade to white label.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know, we might be able to try, you know, kind of.
**Matthew Bryce:** Kind of make some adjustments to the cost once we're into the V2 option.
**Matthew Bryce:** You know, as you know, the prices are going up, but we want to make sure that we're always treating our current customers the best.

**Trevor Cox:** Absolutely.
**Trevor Cox:** Well, hell, yeah, man.
**Trevor Cox:** That was good.
**Trevor Cox:** Really good.

**Matthew Bryce:** Thanks.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, thank you.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, I feel like just the repetition of just going through it a few times really helps.
**Trevor Cox:** Like, you know, also.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** Going back and forth with us, like, where we're still learning, it's nice to.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.

**Trevor Cox:** Kind of get that down.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, no, that was good.
**Matthew Bryce:** I like that.
**Matthew Bryce:** Watching myself, I was like, I just need to slow it down.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's like the.
**Matthew Bryce:** Like, in my mind, I'm like, pump the brakes, pump the brakes, pump the brakes.
**Matthew Bryce:** Slow down.
**Matthew Bryce:** Tell the story.
**Matthew Bryce:** Everybody loves a story.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's the one thing that I've always loved and learned about sales is everybody loves a story.
**Matthew Bryce:** So just tell the story.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh, yeah, absolutely, man.
**Trevor Cox:** Well, heck yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** Well, I have a call at 6 something and then some calls tomorrow.
**Trevor Cox:** But I'd be down to.
**Trevor Cox:** If you wanted to meet up again tomorrow.
**Trevor Cox:** At some point we could do a little bit more practice or whatever you feel comfortable with, but sure, for sure.

**Matthew Bryce:** Awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, I'm available tomorrow.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'll take a look at your calendar and see you have some gaps and I'll just text you, hey, I'd like to jump on and talk.
**Matthew Bryce:** There's also too, if you want, we could even talk about any one of the calls you've had and just kind of like, you know, if there's something, you're like, hey, you know, there's something, you know, these person has this question, I want to practice it.
**Matthew Bryce:** We could practice like specific questions just to make sure somebody asks again.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're prepared.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Trevor Cox:** Sounds like a plan, man.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, man.
**Matthew Bryce:** Awesome.

**Trevor Cox:** Well, I will talk to you soon.

**Matthew Bryce:** You're going to crush it.

**Trevor Cox:** Well, thank you, man.
**Trevor Cox:** Hell yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** Take care, man.
