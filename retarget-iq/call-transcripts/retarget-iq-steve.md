## Transcript

**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** If you need to say anything off the record, we can always kick them out.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
**Steve Maravelias:** I don't think we're doing too.
**Steve Maravelias:** Too confidential.

**Jon Kluger:** Just a little confidential.
**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** No, I'm good at keeping secrets.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't worry.
**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, I appreciate you taking the time today, brother.
**Jon Kluger:** How are you doing this Saturday?
**Jon Kluger:** Where you coming in from?

**Steve Maravelias:** Jersey.
**Steve Maravelias:** Jersey.
**Steve Maravelias:** Good, good.
**Steve Maravelias:** Kind of cold out here.
**Steve Maravelias:** Just, you know, doing some work, like you.
**Steve Maravelias:** You were working on a Saturday?

**Jon Kluger:** Always.
**Jon Kluger:** Always.
**Jon Kluger:** Whereabouts in Jersey?

**Steve Maravelias:** The shore by the beach.
**Steve Maravelias:** Asbury?
**Steve Maravelias:** Belmore?
**Steve Maravelias:** I don't know if you know.

**Jon Kluger:** No, my dad's.
**Jon Kluger:** My dad's from Irvington, so.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** He grew up right by the.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, my dad's almost 80, but he grew up right by the O' Lionel train factory, if you.
**Jon Kluger:** If you know.
**Jon Kluger:** So we, of course, had Lionel set up everywhere when I was a kid because that was his.
**Jon Kluger:** His fascination.
**Jon Kluger:** But we always had fun going back up there.
**Jon Kluger:** I think the last time I went, I was probably 10 or 11 before his buddy moved down to Florida, of course.
**Jon Kluger:** And I just remember looking up like good.
**Jon Kluger:** Like recognizable alumni.
**Jon Kluger:** And the only one that I could recognize from his high school, he said, was Queen Latifah.
**Jon Kluger:** And he goes, oh, yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** I think her mom was a teacher when I was there, too.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was just like.

**Steve Maravelias:** I saw her once.
**Steve Maravelias:** I was on MTV Jersey, short show, and she was, like, the host.
**Steve Maravelias:** And I saw her once.

**Jon Kluger:** Sorry, my dog was barking at my roommate coming in.
**Jon Kluger:** We.
**Jon Kluger:** We're about to get five inches of snow.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm out of Raleigh, North Carolina.

**Steve Maravelias:** Oh, okay.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's a lot for you guys.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, they have no idea what they're doing.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not originally from here.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm from the Washington, D.C. area.
**Jon Kluger:** And I always tell people is like, if there's two inches of snow.
**Jon Kluger:** So I'll actually show you a photo from a few years ago.
**Jon Kluger:** This is what happens to Raleigh when it snows.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, I know.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.
**Steve Maravelias:** Everything gets shut down.
**Steve Maravelias:** Wow.

**Jon Kluger:** Car's on fire with 2 inches of snow on.

**Steve Maravelias:** I don't understand, like.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, people can't really.
**Steve Maravelias:** They really don't know how to drive.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, if you just go slow, usually you're okay.
**Steve Maravelias:** But even in Alabama, I have some family in Alabama.
**Steve Maravelias:** I have some people and friends in Virginia.
**Steve Maravelias:** And with that freezing rain that happened to last from that storm last week.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yep, it was really bad.

**Jon Kluger:** It was bad here with the freezing rain because everything kept melting and during the day, slightly, then it would freeze.
**Jon Kluger:** So all the snow within 48 hours.
**Jon Kluger:** Was ice.
**Jon Kluger:** And I love my dog.
**Jon Kluger:** He's a very smart dog, but he's not very smart when it comes to snow and ice because he probably almost broke my neck, like three times because he started sliding, and then instead of stopping, he went forward and me with him.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was just like, dude, you got to help me out here.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not just going to let go of the leash.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't take me down with you.

**Steve Maravelias:** Oh, my gosh.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's crazy.

**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, Steve, we can dive on in.
**Jon Kluger:** How I usually like to kind of kick off these calls is I'd love to learn a little bit more about you and your business, and then I can cater this presentation.
**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** And demo to your use case.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, I had.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, my thing is, I have a couple small businesses myself.
**Steve Maravelias:** I did actually speak to the owner very briefly, and the other day, I think he.
**Steve Maravelias:** I think I messaged.
**Steve Maravelias:** I set up a call, and I don't know, somehow he messaged me.
**Steve Maravelias:** But basically, you're probably familiar with audience labs, right?
**Steve Maravelias:** One of your competitors.

**Jon Kluger:** Yes, sir.

**Steve Maravelias:** So I was trying to kind of do something with them for a while, and I know a lot of people were having problems, and then one of the guys from over there kind of like said he kind of would set me up, but he never did.
**Steve Maravelias:** It's kind of like I lost like two grand, you know, and then he didn't refund me and.
**Steve Maravelias:** And I just didn't, you know, the customer support really wasn't really there.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like I wanted it to be.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then, like, I'm in the real estate space and in the, like, real estate, motivated sellers.
**Steve Maravelias:** I'm also an agent.
**Steve Maravelias:** I'm also a contractor.
**Steve Maravelias:** So the idea was great, but it never really actually worked because we were getting the.
**Steve Maravelias:** The intent data.
**Steve Maravelias:** We were putting it on, go high level.
**Steve Maravelias:** We were texting, calling.
**Steve Maravelias:** I know a lot of other people were.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then they weren't getting anything.
**Steve Maravelias:** So you can say you have 54 billion data points.
**Steve Maravelias:** And I know not every lead is going to be like a Facebook lead that filled out form and ask 10 questions, but I figure instead of spending 2,000amonth, if you guys are around that 500amonth, maybe try it out and see, you know, what, what it would, you know, what we can be, what we can make of it.

**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** I know you are.
**Jon Kluger:** You are not alone in your frustrations or your experience.
**Jon Kluger:** We've, on average, I probably talked to two to three people a day who are unhappy with their experience at audience Lab.
**Jon Kluger:** They've come over to See what else is available in the market.
**Jon Kluger:** It's fantastic that you recognize the value of intent data because that really is a game changer when it boils down to things.
**Jon Kluger:** What's really nice about us is I can confidently tell you we get our data from a publicly traded company that works with Fortune 100 companies.
**Jon Kluger:** Audience Lab does not have access to the same data as usual.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mention this is that's why our customers are so happy transitioning over.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only are we not charging you an arm and a leg, we don't put limitations on the number of audiences, the number of lists you can build, the number of people on each list.
**Jon Kluger:** Technically there's a cap of a million records per poll, but that's kind of like why are you pulling a million records?
**Jon Kluger:** You don't need a million records.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not very good.

**Steve Maravelias:** I know, I know a lot of the real estate data companies.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, can I ask what company it is that's on the public market?

**Jon Kluger:** It's not real estate specific.
**Jon Kluger:** I can't disclose it.
**Jon Kluger:** What I can tell you is that we are one of three licenses in the world that's allowed to actually leverage their data and then pass it to our clients.
**Jon Kluger:** So there is no one else out there that's doing what we're doing.
**Jon Kluger:** And the beautiful part about it too is not only do we have that core data set, I like to call it our data lake, but we Also waterfall enrich 200 more data sets and data sources into the primary data set to fill in any gaps and to increase the amount of intense signals that we're able to pick up on.
**Jon Kluger:** So I like to joke with my co founders that, you know, technically we are using one of the best data sets in the world, but ours is kind of even better because we add even more.
**Jon Kluger:** So in a way we have even better data than a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's kind of crazy and it's pretty brilliant.
**Jon Kluger:** Awesome.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, so you're one of the founders too then.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm away.
**Jon Kluger:** I. I'm two weeks too late to be a founder.
**Jon Kluger:** I started consulting with the guys back last year when they started the.
**Jon Kluger:** Technically, the business is about three years old.
**Jon Kluger:** The product as we see it now is only.
**Jon Kluger:** We went live back in September.
**Jon Kluger:** I've been consulting with them and came board as a, as a full role as Chief Revenue Officer about a month ago.
**Jon Kluger:** So I've been building out our go to market, our sales or support systems and everything and anything that's needed to make sure that we have a successful program.
**Jon Kluger:** Reason I'm here, I spent the last almost decade building out and running AI and data companies, some of which were valued at over $1 billion.
**Jon Kluger:** So I come in bringing these guys with the experience of selling a really high value SaaS product and high value data.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm looking to help them grow into the powerhouse that we are going to be.
**Jon Kluger:** What's super exciting for you, Steve, is that V1 pricing that you mentioned, $500 a month.
**Jon Kluger:** What's incredible is we're currently running promotion that if you lock in at that price before February 6th, you'll be grandfathered into our V2 with additional features, additional options, additional integrations, and you'll actually get to keep your price.
**Jon Kluger:** I like to mention, I always like to like refer it to.
**Jon Kluger:** Back in the day, my dad had Verizon and we couldn't get a phone upgrade for five years because he had the $20 a month per person unlimited plan.
**Jon Kluger:** And he was like, if we buy a new phone and we don't buy it ourselves, they're gonna jack up our price to 100 bucks a month.

**Steve Maravelias:** So we got.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, yeah, totally.
**Steve Maravelias:** No, it's good.
**Steve Maravelias:** No, definitely.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, I mean, yeah, because with audience labs, Adam Lucerne and all those guys, it was like, it seemed like they had a lot of good ideas where it was like, even my websites, which I'm.
**Steve Maravelias:** I was running ads, I have to run Google Ads again.
**Steve Maravelias:** But I want to do the whole retargeting thing where we buy houses and then even maybe some roofing, some stuff like that.
**Steve Maravelias:** But like they had ways that they were like, like one guy, for example, he went to an agency who had, let's say 100 roofing clients.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then he said, well, I'm gonna give you the pixel for whatever, 50 bucks per pixel.
**Steve Maravelias:** You can put it on your clients computers and then you charge them, you know, an extra 250 or you don't charge them anything and you look like a hero because the leads come back so much better and they do the retargeting.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I'm trying to find out the best way do I, you know, to go ahead for my specific use case as where I can use it myself but then go to like, I can pick off audience labs, I'm in their school group, you know, clients, and then do a referral or work something out too, you guys, and be like, listen, I know there's frustration, you know, like the one guy that got me in that he want, he said he want to work with me again.
**Steve Maravelias:** And he said he was getting frustrated with audience lab and he was running there, I guess, $500 a month thing that people wanted to help learn, you know, and grow.
**Steve Maravelias:** But, like, I feel like he was a little bit all over the place too, but he might just be able to give referrals too.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then if I'm like, grandfathered in with you guys and I'm like.
**Steve Maravelias:** Because I know that it's powerful.
**Steve Maravelias:** It's almost like I have a bazooka, but I don't know how to use it or pull the trigger.

**Jon Kluger:** Don't worry, Steve.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm your drill sergeant.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll get you ready for battle.

**Steve Maravelias:** I like that.
**Steve Maravelias:** I like that.
**Steve Maravelias:** But.
**Steve Maravelias:** But what kind of support do you guys have too?
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, I know you're growing, but like, I'm not a super technical guy.
**Steve Maravelias:** Is it like, all right, Steve, these are.
**Steve Maravelias:** This is our whatever, obviously upwork guy.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's, you know, $8 an hour.
**Steve Maravelias:** That can help you set everything up.
**Steve Maravelias:** Or we'll do it in house, like, you know.

**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** So what we have in the current setup, we have dedicated slack channels for you.
**Jon Kluger:** If you have any issues or any challenges when you're using the platform, take a loom or a video of yourself and the challenge that you're running into, and we'll literally be within 24 hours.
**Jon Kluger:** Someone will have given you direct feedback, direct guidance, and direct support.
**Jon Kluger:** What's really nice is when V2 goes live in on February 15th, we'll have a plethora of video guides, catalogs.
**Jon Kluger:** You literally have an AI that you've been programming, building out for months that will be able to actually answer questions, guide you, and give you additional support.
**Jon Kluger:** We do have the option for white glove support transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** I always tell every one of my clients, we can always add that later if you need it.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's start without it, because I don't want you to pay for something that you don't use.
**Jon Kluger:** And then you go, well, it was 250 bucks a month, Jonathan, and I'm not using it like that could have been two months of that could have been a month of my license.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't want you feeling that way.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I always do is I'm going to be.
**Jon Kluger:** I think the best thing to do is be reactive rather than proactive in this instance.
**Jon Kluger:** Because when money is involved, I never like to see someone essentially spend money that they don't see getting a return of value.
**Jon Kluger:** On with that.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, no, totally.
**Steve Maravelias:** Continue.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, no worries.
**Jon Kluger:** With that being said, what we have that's really amazing is I'll take you through the setup of the platform.
**Jon Kluger:** What I recommend based off of our conversation so far, because there's a really great roofing example that's going to be super powerful for you that we can talk about in a second.
**Jon Kluger:** What I think we should do is we get you set up on a single license.
**Jon Kluger:** For now, when you feel comfortable and you feel good about the platform, we can easily transition you over to a white label.
**Jon Kluger:** A white label is actually.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll show you how the pricing breakdown works.

**Steve Maravelias:** So that would be good because that's what the.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's what the owner was saying.
**Steve Maravelias:** And.
**Steve Maravelias:** And if I'm going to be locked into all those rates and I can just kind of tiptoe in because I am traveling away, I'm going to be going away from like the 10 to the 22nd.
**Steve Maravelias:** So everything's kind of on hold while I'm building out and, you know, rebuilding my funnel.
**Steve Maravelias:** So ideally, in a perfect world, you know, if I could somehow get locked in until like the middle of March when I start running ads again, if that's possible, you know, because then I. I think I definitely do it.
**Steve Maravelias:** If not, you know, then, you know, it kind of is what it is, but.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** So transparently, what you'll see here, this is how our overall pricing breakdown works.
**Jon Kluger:** We have.
**Jon Kluger:** On the left, you see the single license.
**Jon Kluger:** This is all I think you need for now.
**Jon Kluger:** With the single license, if you.
**Jon Kluger:** If you pay quarterly upfront, which is fifteen hundred dollars for the three months you're locked in at that price.
**Jon Kluger:** If you do it before February 6th, you're locked in in perpetuity.
**Jon Kluger:** After February 6th, we're seeing a price increase in anticipation of the launch of the platform on February 15.
**Jon Kluger:** The price increase is probably going to be anywhere between 250 to $500 a license a month.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's really highly recommended.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say we want to wait.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll send you a payment link, you wait until Friday, you make that purchase, you'll automatically get the upgrade to V2 that will be happening when you're away.
**Jon Kluger:** When you get back, you'll be at V2.
**Jon Kluger:** V2 is going to be incredible.
**Jon Kluger:** Once you have V2 live, then you are off to the races.
**Jon Kluger:** You can do unlimited.
**Jon Kluger:** Unlimited everything, essentially.

**Steve Maravelias:** And then I guess.
**Steve Maravelias:** I guess.
**Steve Maravelias:** Would it be feasible to.
**Steve Maravelias:** If I pay for it by Friday, can I just wait to start initially a little bit later?
**Steve Maravelias:** Later.
**Steve Maravelias:** Because if not, I'm just going to be losing it.
**Steve Maravelias:** I'm literally like, everything is on hold.
**Steve Maravelias:** I'm going to Japan.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, I'm jealous.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm so jealous.
**Jon Kluger:** That's, like number one on my bucket list right now.

**Steve Maravelias:** Actually, a lot of people I've been talking to, it's, you know, interesting.
**Steve Maravelias:** It's been on mine more for snowboarding, you know, but.
**Steve Maravelias:** And maybe some Wagyu beef.
**Steve Maravelias:** But.
**Steve Maravelias:** But.

**Jon Kluger:** The founders right now.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me just ask them real quick.
**Jon Kluger:** He wants to pay by February 6 to lock in, but wants access to start and billing to start on the 22nd.
**Jon Kluger:** Is that right?

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.
**Steve Maravelias:** Or let's just say.
**Steve Maravelias:** Let's just say that the 28th.
**Steve Maravelias:** The end of the month when I get back, if possible.
**Steve Maravelias:** So, like, yeah, two, whatever.
**Steve Maravelias:** Three weeks out.
**Steve Maravelias:** We wouldn't even go into March.
**Steve Maravelias:** We'll just do end of February.

**Jon Kluger:** So make sure you get back to me and while we're on the call, so we should know by the end of this demo.
**Jon Kluger:** So.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, Awesome.
**Steve Maravelias:** I appreciate it.
**Steve Maravelias:** Now, now, they're good guys.

**Jon Kluger:** They're pretty easy.
**Jon Kluger:** They're good guys.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm real close with them.
**Jon Kluger:** One of them I've known for eight years now, so they seem really nice.

**Steve Maravelias:** One of them the other day.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, I think you spoke with Alex.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, Alex mentioned that before this call, and he said you're going to like Steve a lot.
**Jon Kluger:** He's a good dude.
**Jon Kluger:** But diving in.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me just cover this one thing and then we'll give you the full demo.
**Jon Kluger:** What I just want to highlight, you lock in at this single license.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say you're happy.
**Jon Kluger:** You're ready to start recruiting formal audience lab people.
**Jon Kluger:** We switch you to a white label.
**Jon Kluger:** What that comes with IS10 licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** It's going to be rebranded to you.
**Jon Kluger:** So instead of it saying retarget IQ right here, we'll say whatever you want it to say.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, you'll get five pixels for each of them for free.
**Jon Kluger:** That's included.
**Jon Kluger:** Every single one of our licenses gets five super pixels fully included.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can do whatever you want with those.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, each additional license is only $100.
**Jon Kluger:** So when our online price shifts to, say, $1,000 a month, you can sell to your clients.
**Jon Kluger:** We're going to set a base rate where we don't allow our white label partners to sell below a certain threshold unless they're including additional things with it.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is we don't want them to devalue the value of the product, essentially.
**Jon Kluger:** That being said, if you go and switch from this quarterly to a monthly right here on the White label, your cost per license actually drops.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you're able to wrangle up a handful more partners, you can just facilitate.
**Jon Kluger:** Hey, John, I need another license.
**Jon Kluger:** Can you go ahead and add one?
**Jon Kluger:** And I'll be like, yeah, anytime, Steve.
**Jon Kluger:** So every time you add more licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you sold 15 people now, your cost per license on a month to month basis are only $300, which means you could theoretically be making, you know, 700 bucks per license off of just simply reselling it to them.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's path of growth if you want to.
**Jon Kluger:** Otherwise we can just rock and roll with the single license at the end of the day.
**Jon Kluger:** With the single license, of course.

**Steve Maravelias:** So, so how much?
**Steve Maravelias:** So, so the single license is how much a month right now?

**Jon Kluger:** Right now you do a month to month at 750.
**Jon Kluger:** If you do quarterly, it's 500amonth.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Did you.

**Steve Maravelias:** I think I said it was, it was a little bit cheaper when you start when we set off, but yeah, but I guess.
**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, so.

**Jon Kluger:** 497.
**Jon Kluger:** But I just like round numbers when I do math with people because it.
**Jon Kluger:** But it's 497.
**Jon Kluger:** Technically that's what you'll get an email for.

**Steve Maravelias:** So then, so then what?
**Steve Maravelias:** So I'd be.
**Steve Maravelias:** So it'd be 1500 then for the three months.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then what about the white label now?
**Steve Maravelias:** Would I get locked in at that price?

**Jon Kluger:** The price today is the price I'll be able to honor.
**Jon Kluger:** If you sign up with B1 pricing, I can honor this with the, with.

**Steve Maravelias:** The quarterly or whatever.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** If you lock in with our single license quarterly before February 6th, I can honor when we upgrade you to white label.
**Jon Kluger:** If we go down that path, I'll honor whatever price we discussed today.
**Jon Kluger:** And you have a recording of me saying that, by the way.

**Steve Maravelias:** Cool.
**Steve Maravelias:** So how much is the white label then?

**Jon Kluger:** A white label on a month to month is 4,000.
**Jon Kluger:** If you do it quarterly, it's 3,650amonth.
**Jon Kluger:** And if you do it annually, it's 3,000amonth.
**Jon Kluger:** What I mean by that is that is for everything included and including API access, the five super pixels per license, so 50 total and you start with 10 licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** Every additional license after 10 is only a hundred dollars.
**Jon Kluger:** So if we add one more license, let's say you're looking at 4100, but your relative value is technically $11,000 when we do the upgrade to V2, because it'll be $1,000 a month for access.
**Jon Kluger:** So the white label gives you a huge Margin and huge opportunity to actually establish an entire new business stream.
**Jon Kluger:** So we actually have clients that have seen how powerful we are, done one license to get a feel for the platform turned around and upgraded to white label because their clients got so much relative value that they wanted to do even more.
**Jon Kluger:** And the reason that we mentioned that is in our current setup we only allow for a single integration into a CRM per license.
**Jon Kluger:** On V2 you'll have the ability to connect to say multiple go high levels, multiple hubspots at an additional 50 to $100 fee per integration.
**Jon Kluger:** But most clients only need one, so that's why we have it set up that way.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I mean by that is a lot of people might have clients that they fully manage the process for where they want to have complete control and no access for their clients.
**Jon Kluger:** They would still only need a single license and just get additional integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** The white label allows for you to essentially set up their own instance for every single conversation for every single client.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can watch them plug it in, you can have them set up, they have unlimited ability to sync, enrich, generate audiences, connect what have you.
**Jon Kluger:** As you can see, we do have a Google Ads connector.
**Jon Kluger:** Unlike Audience Lab, we also have a fantastic meta connector, numerous different CRMs and even more on this page.
**Jon Kluger:** Does that make sense?

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, I mean pretty, pretty good makes sense.
**Steve Maravelias:** As far as so single license, so 10, so $100 and then 5.
**Steve Maravelias:** I'm just looking at the white label.
**Steve Maravelias:** So how, so how can I make money on the, I guess, I guess what would be the use case for me as an individual and then on the white label side as an agency, what are you seeing like so for.

**Jon Kluger:** You as an individual will walk through, through.
**Jon Kluger:** I actually work with a couple people already in the real estate and the roofing business, so there's actually a fantastic use case we'll dive into on the white label.
**Jon Kluger:** You essentially just position yourself as hey, I'm working with these guys, I've done this for myself and seen these results.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want the same results, I have a deal with them where I can actually get you a discount if you work, if you buy it essentially through me.
**Jon Kluger:** And then you're just essentially middleman in the same tech and getting, getting whatever price you want.
**Jon Kluger:** So you could tell them, hey, it's a thousand dollars.
**Jon Kluger:** You could tell them hey it's $700.
**Jon Kluger:** You could even say hey it's $500.
**Jon Kluger:** But as you see, even at $500, if you charge them 500 on a month to month, you're making a hundred dollars license in profit by just being a nice referral.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.
**Steve Maravelias:** So basically what I'm.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I'm paying 400 because it's 4,000 and I have 10.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I'm paying 4, 400 per license.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**Steve Maravelias:** And that's per super pixel.
**Steve Maravelias:** Right?

**Jon Kluger:** Per like you get five super pixels per one of those license.

**Steve Maravelias:** That's what I think I heard, Barb.
**Steve Maravelias:** So, so is that.
**Steve Maravelias:** So could it be different companies?

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, 100.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** So you don't have to do a license per real estate agent.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's say you could have a single instance that has every agent can come into, but how they export it is up to them.
**Jon Kluger:** Or you could sell individual licenses to each agent.
**Jon Kluger:** It's totally up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** That's the beauty of the white label is it gives you the freedom to make any decision any way you want, any method you want, and we find that.

**Steve Maravelias:** I'm sorry.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I'm going to get 50 super pixels basically on the white label.

**Jon Kluger:** And each additional Super Pixel is 50 bucks if you need them.
**Jon Kluger:** But like, if you need more than five per license.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we can work it out.
**Jon Kluger:** We have a scaling ability too.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you go to purchase pixels in mass, we can always find you a better price.
**Jon Kluger:** We can always negotiate that.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm a pretty easy guy, if you haven't been able to tell.
**Jon Kluger:** I fight for my customers because I believe in our product and I want to make sure they have the best experience possible.
**Jon Kluger:** It's more valuable to me that you are a lifelong customer than someone.
**Jon Kluger:** Like what happened with Audience Lab where they just took your money and ran.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't do that.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, no, no, I appreciate it.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, you've heard a lot of bad reviews about them.
**Steve Maravelias:** Oh, they're.

**Jon Kluger:** Steve, they're literally running false ads about us right now.

**Steve Maravelias:** Oh my gosh.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, we literally had someone switch over who said, I've known Adam since the company was started.
**Jon Kluger:** I actually came up with the name Audience Lab.
**Jon Kluger:** He stole the name from me.
**Jon Kluger:** Said as a thanks, here's a license at a locked price.
**Jon Kluger:** Then he upped the price on me two weeks ago, and when I mentioned it to him, he wouldn't respond to me.

**Steve Maravelias:** Oh my gosh.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, he seems like just a little bit dirty, I guess.
**Steve Maravelias:** But like the other.
**Steve Maravelias:** I don't know what he was paying the other guy, but the other guy got messed up.
**Steve Maravelias:** But like just.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, I mean, I think he had good ideas.
**Steve Maravelias:** I would like to use some of those ideas to employ in this.
**Steve Maravelias:** And I'm sure You guys have good ideas too, to say, hey Steve, you know, but so Basically I'm paying 80 bucks per pixel and that's a $4,000 divided by 50 super pixels.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.
**Steve Maravelias:** And with.
**Steve Maravelias:** So with that super pixel, then just to, you know, dumb it down like, you know, as a layman, because I know a little bit about it, not a lot.
**Steve Maravelias:** What would be like, what have you done for marketing for, you know, SaaS, companies, other agencies, other, you know, real estate.

**Jon Kluger:** So we'll dive right into that.
**Jon Kluger:** So the Super Pixel allows for a couple things.
**Jon Kluger:** The Super Pixel allows US to identify 40 to 70% of website visitors regardless of if they disclose information.
**Jon Kluger:** That range is so broad.
**Jon Kluger:** I know reason for that is each website has different permissions.
**Jon Kluger:** If it's a website that you accept all cookies, when you land on the page, it's closer to the 70%.
**Jon Kluger:** If it's a website that no one says yes, they hit decline on all cookies.
**Jon Kluger:** We have about a 40% chance of identification.
**Jon Kluger:** What it allows for us to do is not only identify the top pages that people are visiting, but we can look at the top sources they're coming in from and even their locations.
**Jon Kluger:** So the reason I love this, especially for any sort of trade or service based opportunity is we can literally zoom in.
**Jon Kluger:** I like to use Dallas as an example because Dallas Fort Worth is so massive.
**Jon Kluger:** Right.
**Jon Kluger:** So from a wide view, you see about 99 visitors from that area.
**Jon Kluger:** As we zoom in, you'll actually see they disperse to where actually they're concentrated.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you're a roofing company that has a location here.

**Steve Maravelias:** So this is all roofing pixels.
**Steve Maravelias:** This is like roofing websites or is this just general?
**Steve Maravelias:** This is super general.

**Jon Kluger:** This is super general.
**Jon Kluger:** This can work for, for anyone.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm just using for an example because it's very location based.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** What you can see here is let's say you had an office in Dallas.
**Jon Kluger:** Now you can go, actually I should be in an area Arlington, because there's actually more of a demand or more visitors over there than there is here in Dallas.
**Jon Kluger:** That's probably because there's a demand for me and my work there and my ads are working.
**Jon Kluger:** But maybe they need to be a little more geospecific.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's the homepage.
**Jon Kluger:** If we look at the analytics that were pulled in, we can look at the exact demographic of the audience.
**Jon Kluger:** Where are they coming from, how much are they making, their age, their gender, the device type.
**Jon Kluger:** On V2, you'll even be able to see things like are they A homeowner?
**Jon Kluger:** Are they not a homeowner?
**Jon Kluger:** So there's some pretty in depth things.
**Jon Kluger:** Then we ask, okay, that's great, Jonathan.
**Jon Kluger:** What else does it capture?
**Jon Kluger:** Well, we're actually able to see some pretty in depth information about each person.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing that you'll notice right away, we are able to pull the address of every single person that we identify.
**Jon Kluger:** Why is that important?
**Jon Kluger:** Well, if you're a roofing company, you need to know where the roof is at the end of the day.
**Jon Kluger:** So this allows for you to identify that.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, the amount of data we're actually able to pull on each of these people is pretty astounding.
**Jon Kluger:** So you'll see here we can look at income, net worth, credit range, are they a homeowner?
**Jon Kluger:** What's the value of their home?
**Jon Kluger:** What's contact information, behaviors and the properties they own and their relative value.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's just on website visitor.
**Jon Kluger:** Where our platform is truly inspirational is intent data.
**Jon Kluger:** Are you familiar with intent data?

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, yeah, let's.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's kind of like.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, basically, I guess people that have almost like with Google searched in or went to a site.

**Jon Kluger:** So if I like buying signals, it's like someone waving a flag saying, hey, I'm looking, I'm looking for something.
**Jon Kluger:** And why intent data is so valuable is because it creates that indication that they're ready to buy.
**Jon Kluger:** And what happens when people are ready to buy?
**Jon Kluger:** They typically make that decision in a relatively quick process.
**Jon Kluger:** Or if you're able to identify that and get in front of them, it gives you a leg up on the opportunity to get their business.
**Jon Kluger:** So one example will do roofing.

**Steve Maravelias:** Can I. Yeah.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then can I give a website as an example too after to be.

**Jon Kluger:** Able to pull data from, we need to actually have the super Pixel placed onto that website.
**Jon Kluger:** So I can't poll, but we can, we can do other types of, of intent data polls.
**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.

**Steve Maravelias:** Oh, okay.
**Steve Maravelias:** I didn't know if it was like, like I'm in motivate.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I'm, I'm real estate investors.
**Steve Maravelias:** So for me there's like opendoor.com homevestors.com.

**Jon Kluger:** But if we wanted to pull, we can, we can pull for people who are looking open door, we can pull for those things.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Steve Maravelias:** But nice.

**Jon Kluger:** What's going to happen in V2, which you're going to be really excited about, is you actually can put anything as a keyword and we'll be able to locate it and search for those topics.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you have a very specific niche that you're looking for we can incorporate that in and V1 right now, transparently, we're limited to about 40,010 topics, which is still a lot.
**Jon Kluger:** And by the time you get back from Japan, you won't have to worry because you can put anything in.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, so I can put like sell my home fast.
**Steve Maravelias:** Sell my home fast.
**Steve Maravelias:** But CAD and then do a geolocation.
**Steve Maravelias:** So if I want to do and then if I had that data, then what am I doing then am I calling them, texting them, doing a fixed Facebook retargeting campaign and submitting their emails?
**Steve Maravelias:** What do you recommend?

**Jon Kluger:** D. All of the above.
**Jon Kluger:** But what you might actually really like when we do this roofing example, I have a client who it works with roofers.
**Jon Kluger:** He pulled intent categories for roof repair.
**Jon Kluger:** He finds the ones that are listed as high intent.
**Jon Kluger:** So when we list our out our intent, you'll see low, medium, high.
**Jon Kluger:** I like to look at low as a B where that's good, we're happy with that.
**Jon Kluger:** Medium is an A, which is like, yeah, we definitely need to reach out.
**Jon Kluger:** High is an A plus where it's like, oh, we need to get there asap.
**Jon Kluger:** What's really nice with the roofers is he'll generate a list, he'll filter for high intent.
**Jon Kluger:** He'll export that list, he'll plug it into chat GPT and tell it to give me a knocking path.
**Jon Kluger:** Then he gets in his roofing car, puts on his roofing outfit where it says his company, it says everything.
**Jon Kluger:** And he drives from house to house and he just knocks on their door and he goes, hey, I was in the neighborhood working on, on a roof.
**Jon Kluger:** I noticed a few of your shingles were missing.
**Jon Kluger:** Did you have any interest in maybe having someone appraise or see how much it might cost to get your roof repaired?
**Jon Kluger:** And every single person, he goes, goes, oh my God.
**Jon Kluger:** I just, I was researching that this week.
**Jon Kluger:** I noticed that there was an issue.
**Jon Kluger:** I'd love it if you could just climb up on my roof and check on my roof for me.
**Jon Kluger:** And then every single high intent person becomes an in person sale.
**Jon Kluger:** Because a lot of these roofing Companies, yes, we 100% encourage that you do targeted ads.
**Jon Kluger:** Yes, we 100% encourage that you do email outreach.
**Jon Kluger:** But by going door to door with incredibly high intent people, you're gonna basically be knocking on the door and someone's gonna be like, oh my God, I needed you.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, totally.
**Steve Maravelias:** Well, that's what, that's what I think the owner was saying.
**Steve Maravelias:** But if you even wanted to go even crazier and really.
**Steve Maravelias:** So you're not driving all over the place and do like roofing and then you do siding and then you do, you know, you know, kitchen or baths, because I can do all that.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then you put it all in and you're like targeting, let's say area.
**Steve Maravelias:** You're like chat gbt.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then you walk in and be like, you know.

**Jon Kluger:** 100 for door to door if you're doing it that way.
**Jon Kluger:** But what I would recommend is if you're running ads, segment them out.
**Jon Kluger:** And what I mean by that is if you're running an ad in a very specific geo for say root repair, have a very simple Facebook, like a very simple graphic that says, do you need roof repair in the Jersey Shore?
**Jon Kluger:** That's gonna come.
**Jon Kluger:** That's gonna actually perform a lot better than if you list out all of your services and everything.
**Jon Kluger:** Because then it doesn't feel as highly personalized to the audience.

**Steve Maravelias:** Well, that's what I was saying.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like if, let's say there's a, whatever 30 block radius and I don't know how, how far it is, if it's like only in the last week or whatever.
**Steve Maravelias:** But you have, I'm, I'm a general contractor, so I can say I can go to one house and who had high intent on roofing and be like, like you're saying, hey, we're doing roofing repairs in the area.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then let's say eight houses away.
**Steve Maravelias:** The guy had an intent for kitchen.
**Steve Maravelias:** Hey, we're doing a kitchen down the street.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then that way we bang it out.
**Steve Maravelias:** And you were going, we approached them at the door for, oh, well, this guy isn't showing up asking for a kitchen when it was the roof.
**Steve Maravelias:** But that, that could be really, really big too.
**Steve Maravelias:** For sure.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** And, and by the way, I just got approval.
**Jon Kluger:** We can do that.
**Jon Kluger:** If you pay before February 6th, we'll have your license and everything turned on February 28th and that will be the beginning of your billing cycle.
**Jon Kluger:** I just got the confirmation, by the way.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.
**Steve Maravelias:** So it would just be 500amonth.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then if I wanted to upgrade, I'm locked in at that upgrade price.

**Jon Kluger:** Yep.
**Jon Kluger:** That we discussed.
**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**Steve Maravelias:** 4,000.
**Steve Maravelias:** Now how much is that going to go up to after February 6th?
**Steve Maravelias:** Is that going up to 5,000 or is that going to be.

**Jon Kluger:** It's, it's going to be pretty si.
**Jon Kluger:** At least 5,000, I would say, if not more.
**Jon Kluger:** We're, we're finalizing the prices on that.
**Jon Kluger:** We want to be able to ensure that we, we keep adding features for the V2 launch because we're so excited.
**Jon Kluger:** So we want to make sure that Once we launch V2, we have all the prices that reflect the relative value.

**Steve Maravelias:** So I may need some time.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, I, like, I want to do it like, and I can stop what I'm doing.
**Steve Maravelias:** I just don't.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, I want to build my skill before I go and upgrade because it's a lot of money every month when.

**Jon Kluger:** You, when you upgrade, you're locked in at the 500amonth for the first three months and continuously after that.
**Jon Kluger:** At any point during those three months, if you call me up and go, jonathan, I want to upgrade, what we'll do is roll, prorate the rest of that three months and roll it into your first payment of the white label.
**Jon Kluger:** So don't feel like you need to rush.
**Jon Kluger:** I, like I said before, I'll honor the 4,000amonth that we talked about.
**Jon Kluger:** So you don't, you don't have anything to worry about, my friend.
**Jon Kluger:** I've got that.
**Jon Kluger:** I got you covered now.

**Steve Maravelias:** Now with the 500, is that like, is that 1 pixel with 10.
**Steve Maravelias:** 5 licenses?

**Jon Kluger:** 5 pixels.

**Steve Maravelias:** 5 pixels, 5 super pixels.
**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I can basically put them on.
**Steve Maravelias:** I, I can still put them on client sites.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.
**Steve Maravelias:** And they won't know.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, I'll have the login and then I can put a super pixel, let's say, on whatever a client site and still make money that way and tell them.
**Steve Maravelias:** It's going to be like, I just got to see what the average prices are for all those.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, if it's, if I'm putting the pixel on, is that.
**Steve Maravelias:** How much is that?
**Steve Maravelias:** Normally, if I'm pulling a list for roofers and giving to them every week, how much do you charge for that of roofers in the area?
**Steve Maravelias:** So I guess that's what I'm trying to.

**Jon Kluger:** Steve, we're 500 bucks.
**Jon Kluger:** Includes unlimited data polls for intent.
**Jon Kluger:** You can do as many as you want, as many audiences as you want.
**Jon Kluger:** You can have it update every single day if you want.
**Jon Kluger:** We actually have an ability for you to set it up to update every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** You can send those updated lists to ad accounts every single day, and it will actually cycle out.
**Jon Kluger:** The people that no longer show intent, the super pixels are included, Five of them.
**Jon Kluger:** You can do whatever you want.

**Steve Maravelias:** Well, yeah, so, so what I'm saying, like, as many case studies as you can give me on the retail side as an agency, to be like, okay, this is how much you charge a real estate agent, like you said, or the other Guy was selling something else.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, this is with their.
**Steve Maravelias:** You know, if, like, that would be helpful, I think, and you guys can build the agency side of things transparent.

**Jon Kluger:** You know, right now, we're putting together and growing those assets, and we're.
**Jon Kluger:** We're.
**Jon Kluger:** We're going to Launch them with V2.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll have everything that you need for a white label partner to be able to sell, position, etc.
**Jon Kluger:** With that being said in the intro, what we just want you to be able to do is feel comfortable.
**Jon Kluger:** And you know what?
**Jon Kluger:** You are the best case study.
**Jon Kluger:** If we can get you set up and live with a single account and you are happy, and you see the incredible results that we've experienced with every single one of our clients, you become the case study.
**Jon Kluger:** You become the testimonial.
**Jon Kluger:** You literally are turning to your clients and saying, hey, this works so well for me.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, you guys need to do this, and I can help you.
**Jon Kluger:** And then it becomes an easy sell for you.

**Steve Maravelias:** Well, that's what I want to learn the depth of.
**Steve Maravelias:** Because, like, for example, my friend is a.
**Steve Maravelias:** Is a plastic surgeon in Orlando, Florida.
**Steve Maravelias:** He does boobs, butts, whatever, lips.

**Jon Kluger:** So I want to be able to say, he's doing God, Steve.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, he's doing God's work.
**Steve Maravelias:** Exactly.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I want to go to him and say, hey, hey, Nick.
**Steve Maravelias:** His name's Nick.
**Steve Maravelias:** You know, we can pull this data.
**Steve Maravelias:** You know what I mean?
**Steve Maravelias:** We can do a trial or whatever, and we can.
**Steve Maravelias:** You know, instead of you paying a lot of money for Facebook ads, I'm going to pull a list of everybody that's looked at any, you know, plastic surgery site in the last 30 days in Orlando, and then we're going to retarget them.
**Steve Maravelias:** And the price is always so much cheaper to retarget.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I'm just figuring out all the different ways that I can approach it.
**Steve Maravelias:** Hey, can you hold on one second?
**Steve Maravelias:** Sorry.
**Steve Maravelias:** This is my contractor.
**Steve Maravelias:** Sorry.
**Steve Maravelias:** Hey, Diaz, how you doing?
**Steve Maravelias:** If you can change it, just another one basic, so it's new.
**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, great.

**Jon Kluger:** Thanks.
**Jon Kluger:** Thank you.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, I'm back.

**Jon Kluger:** You know, worries.
**Jon Kluger:** Cryptocurrency just took a tumble.
**Jon Kluger:** Interesting.

**Steve Maravelias:** Oh, I know, I know.
**Steve Maravelias:** I've been watching it.
**Steve Maravelias:** Well, really, I called it.
**Steve Maravelias:** I called the gold top Wednesday night and silver top in a group chat, and they were like, how the hell did you do that?
**Steve Maravelias:** Because, like, all the stars aligned.
**Steve Maravelias:** Because I do a lot of charting.
**Steve Maravelias:** And, you know, of course, with everything else with the bank, that bank went under in Chicago, and they raised a margin rate, so they must have just.

**Jon Kluger:** Passed the crypto bill or something.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry, my ADHD got me distracted.

**Steve Maravelias:** I was just watching it too.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, bitcoin is down, so it stinks.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, everything was down 40 in the last three days.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** No, I mean I got, I, I've had been accumulating silver for a few months and yesterday was a sad day for me.
**Jon Kluger:** I, I'm not upset because I'm not losing money, but it's kind of like, ah, that's not fun.
**Jon Kluger:** But the best part about crypto now because I'm just going to sell everything immediately, buy back and it will be great for my taxes next year.

**Steve Maravelias:** Hey, there's always, people always do different weird stuff for tax reasons.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like my buddy bought a couple software stocks like HubSpot and he's down and another one he's down because they just got.
**Steve Maravelias:** Everyone thinks, hey, I was going to replace him.
**Steve Maravelias:** He's like, he's like, I'm down 27,000, what should I do?
**Steve Maravelias:** Do I sell for tax purposes or not?
**Steve Maravelias:** And I was like, just don't, just do it.
**Steve Maravelias:** Don't think about tax purposes.
**Steve Maravelias:** Just sell it and do something else.
**Steve Maravelias:** I was like, and don't trade ever again.
**Steve Maravelias:** Because we always have this conversation.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, everybody gets emotional with trading.
**Steve Maravelias:** It's not easy, you know.

**Jon Kluger:** Well, my, my whole thing with crypto is they, they still allow for walk, they don't allow for it doesn't have wash sales.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you exit like on December 31st this year, I sold everything and then bought it all back on January 1st and that literally made it that any money I've lost goes on last year's taxes and now this year, if I start at a lower threshold, if crypto continues, continues to fall, I just sell and then buy back in at the end of the calendar year.
**Jon Kluger:** But if it goes up, I just hold it forever and I'm good to go.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, nice.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's a good idea.

**Jon Kluger:** So I just did a quick poll for you by the way of people looking for plastic surgery in Orlando.
**Jon Kluger:** So we found about 888.
**Jon Kluger:** This is over the last two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** We only look at a two week window for intent because typically within those two weeks someone has made a decision or found their source that they're looking for.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't want to go back like let's say a month because then you're wasting ad spend on someone who might have already found their surgeon, done a consultation, what have you.
**Jon Kluger:** But yeah, how we're able to help with this is let's say we hit download all we'll say, Orlando plastic surgery.
**Jon Kluger:** We hit save up here.
**Jon Kluger:** We have the ability to hit schedule now.
**Jon Kluger:** We can have this refresh every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** So the people that no longer have intent and it brings up the people that do.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we can schedule to have it every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** Update your targeting on meta.
**Jon Kluger:** So your Facebook and Instagram ads will literally have a fresh target every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** So if people are no longer showing intent, you're no longer spending money on targeting them.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, that's great.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, I didn't know it was automatic like that.

**Jon Kluger:** So you can set it up.
**Jon Kluger:** It's.
**Jon Kluger:** It's literally what this can do for you, Steve, is you can find an account or client, let's say your buddy, and you can literally say, hey, what's your friend's name?

**Steve Maravelias:** Nick.

**Jon Kluger:** Hey, Nick.
**Jon Kluger:** For 500 bucks a month, you don't even need a license for him.
**Jon Kluger:** For 500 bucks a month, I'll have a fresh set every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** Of audiences that we target for outreach on ads that automatically update.
**Jon Kluger:** And if you build out a list that fits and it's high performing, you literally never have to do anything because it just keeps hitting them and it cycles out the people that are already, that are already converting and it just brings in new people.
**Jon Kluger:** So easy to set up.

**Steve Maravelias:** We buy houses, cash.
**Steve Maravelias:** No, that's awesome.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's awesome.

**Jon Kluger:** Exactly.
**Jon Kluger:** And so that's where, let's say you want to start by doing this yourself.
**Jon Kluger:** You can.
**Jon Kluger:** In V2, all you need to do is set up the extra integrations and you're good to go.
**Jon Kluger:** You could literally have 10 clients and do an hour of work every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** And that's it.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, I was even going to have my son do it.
**Steve Maravelias:** You just have to find the clients.
**Steve Maravelias:** Does anybody offer trials?
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, is it a way that I can say.

**Jon Kluger:** Because you could, you could send them the data.
**Jon Kluger:** Yes.
**Jon Kluger:** I can't give you a trial or give you data beforehand because our data provider doesn't allow for that.
**Jon Kluger:** But if you wanted to generate lists for people and just say, hey, here's the list, go check it out, see if it's good, and they'll come back to you and go home.
**Jon Kluger:** Shit, Steve, the list was incredible.
**Jon Kluger:** And then you're going to be like, well, I can do that every single day or once a week, or once a month, whatever you determine.
**Jon Kluger:** And you can literally explain it to them as, hey, don't you stress.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, for, for 500 bucks a month, I'll have this list to you every single week.

**Steve Maravelias:** I Think that's what I want to do.
**Steve Maravelias:** So basically, are you saying that once I buy this.
**Steve Maravelias:** So let's say, let's say I'm like thinking about doing white label.
**Steve Maravelias:** I don't want to do it yet, but I can.
**Steve Maravelias:** Basically I'm going to have that account.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I can call, I don't know, let's just say a Medispa.
**Steve Maravelias:** And I'm like, listen, you know, this is a list you can give to your.
**Steve Maravelias:** I don't want to step on your agency's tone.
**Steve Maravelias:** If you're using the agency, you can give them this list and it's going to be sent to you every day at 8am Or I can run ads for you for a thousand dollars a month with this list.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then you just do ad spend.
**Steve Maravelias:** Right.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I can give them different options?

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**Steve Maravelias:** Some of them, you know, so that's.
**Steve Maravelias:** I guess, I think so.
**Steve Maravelias:** Then I can use my.
**Steve Maravelias:** What I'm paying, 500amonth to get.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, to get the clients.

**Jon Kluger:** You can transition to white label when you're ready.
**Jon Kluger:** And they can each have their own individualized portal where they'll see the Super Pixel results, will see everything.
**Jon Kluger:** They can go in.
**Jon Kluger:** You can even teach them how to use the tool if you choose.
**Jon Kluger:** Or you can just let them know that, hey, I have an instance here.
**Jon Kluger:** You can go look at your analytics on your website.
**Jon Kluger:** You can go look at where the visitors are.
**Jon Kluger:** You can go look at the actual visitors.
**Jon Kluger:** One thing I didn't even mention, Steve, we have direct mail.
**Jon Kluger:** So you can actually create triggers on people's websites that they get a physical mailer.
**Jon Kluger:** So if someone went through a website and they went to like, we buy your house for cash.
**Jon Kluger:** And they land on the website and they click on the link for like, get a quote or learn more or whatever it is.
**Jon Kluger:** You can literally have them get a piece of physical mail sent to their house.

**Steve Maravelias:** Nice.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's awesome.
**Steve Maravelias:** Can you do one more search on.
**Steve Maravelias:** On like, we buy houses in New Jersey.
**Steve Maravelias:** How many people possible?
**Steve Maravelias:** So we can look up my home fast.

**Jon Kluger:** We can look up a house.
**Jon Kluger:** We can look up real estate sellers.
**Jon Kluger:** We can look up houses for sale.

**Steve Maravelias:** Real estate sellers are good.
**Steve Maravelias:** Really be real.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, really.
**Steve Maravelias:** We want motivated sellers.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, sell my home cash.
**Steve Maravelias:** I don't know.
**Steve Maravelias:** I wanna.

**Jon Kluger:** That's like home selling right here.
**Jon Kluger:** Like I mentioned V2, when you come back from Japan, you can put any phrase you want it.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, yeah, gotcha.

**Jon Kluger:** But we have home selling in New Jersey.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll do this one.
**Jon Kluger:** Let's have some fun.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll do it in the last week.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll set the state to New Jersey, and then what we're going to do is we're going to filter for homeowners, too.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Because that way you're only targeting people that are confirmed to own a home.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.
**Steve Maravelias:** Home sellers and homeowners.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, now remember, this is only here 15 to 20 minutes because we had a very impatient client, and he was like, why isn't it instant?
**Jon Kluger:** And we're like, dude, you're trying to pull a million records.
**Jon Kluger:** It takes a minute or two.
**Jon Kluger:** So what I always tell people is check your phone, check your email, then just hit refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** So in the state of New Jersey, we have 24,716 people that own a home that have been looking up home selling.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**Steve Maravelias:** Nice.
**Steve Maravelias:** And.
**Steve Maravelias:** And there's no, we don't.
**Steve Maravelias:** It's just home selling.
**Steve Maravelias:** But afterwards, I can pinpoint and I can type my home cash.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.
**Steve Maravelias:** Because that's.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's more.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, that's what.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's great.
**Steve Maravelias:** Home selling.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, so that means they went to what, Zillow.com.
**Steve Maravelias:** what would you say that attributes what they.

**Jon Kluger:** They're showing the behavior of someone who's trying to sell their home.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, but it does.
**Steve Maravelias:** Does it give the actual websites that they went to or.

**Jon Kluger:** No, not currently in V2, we will actually have the ability.
**Jon Kluger:** This is something that we haven't finalized pricing on transparently.
**Jon Kluger:** And we're still figuring out how we want to structure it.
**Jon Kluger:** But what we'll be able to do is we'll be able to put pixels on other people's websites.
**Jon Kluger:** So you could theoretically pixel on Zillow's website to capture people who's going to Zillow?

**Steve Maravelias:** So when is that going to happen?

**Jon Kluger:** That's.
**Jon Kluger:** That's going to happen in the next couple weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** That's going to be an extra cost transparently because of the overhead that it cost us to do.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll be able to figure that out.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll work that out, and I'll bring it to you and I'll let you know what it's likely going to be is that one's going to be on record count.
**Jon Kluger:** Because let's say you put a pixel on Zillow versus you put a pixel on a local Realtor's own website.
**Jon Kluger:** That's a competitor.
**Jon Kluger:** We're not going to be able to charge the same for both of those because the Zillow is going to have tens of millions of more visitors than the single local guy.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're finalizing how pricing is going to look about that.
**Jon Kluger:** But to your point, what's super exciting about that is we will be able to have that to offer where we can actually capture if they're visiting a competitor site.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, so.
**Steve Maravelias:** So you can go.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I can type in Open Door or all the local home buyers in my area and anybody that goes to their site, I can.
**Steve Maravelias:** Right here.

**Jon Kluger:** Open Door.

**Steve Maravelias:** So you have Open Door.
**Steve Maravelias:** Nice.
**Steve Maravelias:** So you can click that and then.

**Jon Kluger:** And see if we have Zillow.
**Jon Kluger:** We have Zillow as well.

**Steve Maravelias:** Well, what if you check Open Door right now?
**Steve Maravelias:** I'm curious, can you do a search or no?

**Jon Kluger:** And if you can't tell, have you noticed we don't have a cap on the number of audiences you could build?
**Jon Kluger:** So you could do.

**Steve Maravelias:** That's the other thing too.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, for example.
**Steve Maravelias:** I understand.
**Steve Maravelias:** So here's my devil's advocate question of me being.
**Steve Maravelias:** And I'm not, you know, like, obviously I can pull lists and run lists unlimited under my one account.
**Steve Maravelias:** And it won't be automated if I'm like, okay, because I'll have five different pixels or five different ad accounts.
**Steve Maravelias:** But then when it gets to that time that I end up having enough clients, let's say over five or over 10, then I'll do the super pixel and then be like, okay, this is, you know, then it'll be automated that they can run their ads and have their own accounts.
**Steve Maravelias:** So I'll just be super limited.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, I could still help a roofer out manually doing it.

**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.
**Steve Maravelias:** Because it's unlimited records and it's unlimited.

**Jon Kluger:** Industries and you can have unlimited queries that automatically refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** It's just a matter of the integration.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to automatically have it pushed into their accounts or automatically have it pushed into other areas, that is just limited.
**Jon Kluger:** Because what we've created, we don't want people accidentally sending roofing data to their real estate clients and then that's stuck in their CRM and then you have to clean up the CRM and then everyone's mad at you because you pushed the wrong data to the wrong place and yada yada, yada, yada.
**Jon Kluger:** So that's where the white label can be useful, is it keeps everything confined and it keeps any possibility of data spillage or confusion or errors completely away.
**Jon Kluger:** So Here you go.
**Jon Kluger:** 33,257 homeowners in the state of New Jersey has visited Opendoor or has intent towards Open Door.

**Steve Maravelias:** That's opendoor.com.
**Steve Maravelias:** that's.

**Jon Kluger:** Yes, sir.

**Steve Maravelias:** So those are all people that looking to get a cash offer.
**Steve Maravelias:** Now, how many of those are I see?
**Steve Maravelias:** A lot of them are low.
**Steve Maravelias:** If you go to score category, are there going to be a lot that are high or they're most of them going to be low?

**Jon Kluger:** So it varies, but like I mentioned earlier on the call, people who are low are still that B grade.
**Jon Kluger:** They're not.
**Jon Kluger:** They're not people you want to necessarily omit.
**Jon Kluger:** They're just at the early stage of their buying journey.
**Jon Kluger:** They're showing early signs of intent.
**Jon Kluger:** So, like, if someone shows low intent today, tomorrow they could be on medium.
**Jon Kluger:** The next day they could be on high, or they could instantly be on medium or instantly be on high.
**Jon Kluger:** It's all developed based off of their behaviors across the way.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, gotcha, gotcha.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, what is your.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, for example, like, even my buddy, he has a, you know, not to jump away from this because this is the most interesting to me.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then the construction afterwards and then obviously the white label.
**Steve Maravelias:** But, like, if you go to score category, are you allowed to put the tab and then go to high and see how many people are high or do you think most of them are going to be low?

**Jon Kluger:** You can filter for that?

**Steve Maravelias:** Oh, you can?
**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**Steve Maravelias:** And this is opendoor.com for sure.
**Steve Maravelias:** That many people went there?

**Jon Kluger:** Yes, sir.

**Steve Maravelias:** So it's almost like retargeting anyway and pulling.
**Steve Maravelias:** Pulling that anyway, almost.
**Steve Maravelias:** If you're doing that, like, correct.
**Steve Maravelias:** Can you hold on one second?
**Steve Maravelias:** I just got to put a.
**Steve Maravelias:** Give my guy a credit card and then.
**Steve Maravelias:** All right, hold on a second.
**Steve Maravelias:** Hey, how you doing?

**Jon Kluger:** How are you?

**Steve Maravelias:** Good, good.
**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, let me get you the card number here.
**Steve Maravelias:** Real.
**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, so it's.
**Steve Maravelias:** 1028.
**Steve Maravelias:** 77 1.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, thanks so much.

**Steve Maravelias:** Thank you.
**Steve Maravelias:** Hey, how you doing, John?
**Steve Maravelias:** Sorry about that.
**Steve Maravelias:** That's great.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, like my buddy, for example, so I can go to my buddy who it does wedding events and just say, hey, Chuck, you know, bridal showers or whatever.
**Steve Maravelias:** People are looking at bridal shows or people looking.
**Steve Maravelias:** Whatever.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then I can do the same thing with him.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean, where.
**Steve Maravelias:** What industries are you seeing the most stuff come in?
**Steve Maravelias:** Because I feel like I've gotten excited about this pixel before, but I feel like audience labs wasn't accurate and even like.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then what do you like on the referral side?
**Steve Maravelias:** If I do get audience labs, people do I just.
**Steve Maravelias:** Do you give a referral?
**Steve Maravelias:** What if I want to do white label?
**Steve Maravelias:** Would you give me, like, a fee for that?
**Steve Maravelias:** Or, hey, you give me.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, like.
**Steve Maravelias:** Or do I just take them on as white label.

**Jon Kluger:** So you could take them on and you can make margin off of them literally just by them signing up through you as a white label partner.
**Jon Kluger:** Or if you're more interested in passing leads over to us and having a referral fee for everyone that signs up, that's something that we can, we can, we can look to establish for you as well.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, perfect.
**Steve Maravelias:** I mean how, how much, how much more accurate do you think yours is?
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, you know, because I know audience labs say they used to get 70% but I guess it wasn't that accuracy rate.
**Steve Maravelias:** So you think your accuracy score is like, like double what there was or at least like 30% better?

**Jon Kluger:** I would confidently say that we are better.
**Jon Kluger:** And I can tell you that every single client that switched over from audience lab, I can send you screenshots of their messages, they have told us it's better we don't have access to their data unlike they like to claim we do.
**Jon Kluger:** So we don't even look at their data.
**Jon Kluger:** So we can't do a head to head.
**Jon Kluger:** If you say had audience lab and us at the same time, you can 100 pull the exact same list, put them head to head and see which one's better.
**Jon Kluger:** But yeah, we're confident that we are.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, it sounds that way.
**Steve Maravelias:** How many people came over?
**Steve Maravelias:** About 10 or 20 people more.
**Steve Maravelias:** Okay, so you, so they've already been.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, I guess we get two a day.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.
**Steve Maravelias:** That, that sign up for the monthly or they sign up for the white label?

**Jon Kluger:** Most of them.
**Jon Kluger:** How?
**Jon Kluger:** I always tell everybody, everyone I work with, I say start with a, a monthly or a quarterly plan.
**Jon Kluger:** When you're comfortable, we'll upgrade you to the white label when it makes sense for your business.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't over prescribe, I don't oversell.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't need the money so desperately that I'm going to screw over my clients.
**Jon Kluger:** I'd rather you and be grateful of our partnership than reluctant because I over prescribed you early on.

**Steve Maravelias:** Awesome.
**Steve Maravelias:** No, I appreciate it.
**Steve Maravelias:** Now what about, I guess what, what industries are you seeing this work in?
**Steve Maravelias:** Like for example, I know, the roofing example, the real estate example.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like if you were like, if I was like, hey John, like, like let's say I didn't have anything to do with any of those.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like where should I go?

**Jon Kluger:** Is it like Steve, everything?
**Jon Kluger:** Everything.
**Jon Kluger:** Because think about people's behavior on the Internet.
**Jon Kluger:** Everyone does their own research now.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, like, like this one guy was doing legal, he was going.
**Steve Maravelias:** Because obviously if you go by the highest pay per clicks that are Generally, like, what is it?
**Steve Maravelias:** Slip and fall Injury attorneys are like the highest pay per clicks.
**Steve Maravelias:** So you could technically go to them and say, like, listen, you know, who's running your ads for you or whatever, and then work something like that.

**Jon Kluger:** Personal injury law right there.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, personal injury law, Exactly.

**Jon Kluger:** You can do it.

**Steve Maravelias:** Nice, Nice.

**Jon Kluger:** Now I will be transparent.
**Jon Kluger:** Steve, I do have another call in just two minutes.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, what I'm gonna do, I just sent over the payment link to you for the quarterly.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to go ahead and knock that out sometime this week, just email me and let me know.
**Jon Kluger:** The team already knows that you're going to want your account going live at the end of the month and for the billing cycle begin then.

**Jon Kluger:** You just have to make sure you lock in your payment before February 6th.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll follow up with an email with this link as well, for your convenience so that you can have it as well.

**Steve Maravelias:** Okay.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.
**Steve Maravelias:** I'm curious just to see how.
**Steve Maravelias:** How it's going to be if I put cold callers, texters, or whatever on it.
**Steve Maravelias:** Like, you know what.
**Steve Maravelias:** What is going to be the situation?
**Steve Maravelias:** And I'm obviously very optimistic, but I was with audience labs, too, but you guys seem like you're local.
**Steve Maravelias:** You're the real deal.
**Steve Maravelias:** I don't think you guys would be just trying to, you know, do anything, you know, decision owner.
**Steve Maravelias:** Sounds cool.
**Steve Maravelias:** You know, kind of put you in that category as him.

**Jon Kluger:** The.
**Jon Kluger:** The man who taught me my sales knowledge, my.
**Jon Kluger:** My how I.
**Jon Kluger:** How I do business was my grandfather.
**Jon Kluger:** He used to fly to China to buy shoes in the 60s and spend a million dollars in the 60s on a handshake agreement to be able to get shoes to sell in the United States.

**Steve Maravelias:** Wow, that's great.

**Jon Kluger:** Your word is only as strong as you make it.
**Jon Kluger:** And I live by the fact that I am transparent.
**Jon Kluger:** I fight for you.
**Jon Kluger:** And I'm not gonna.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm not gonna.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, because no one.
**Jon Kluger:** We live in a world where there's so much.
**Jon Kluger:** The least I can do is be a reliable and honest partner.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.
**Steve Maravelias:** Well, listen, I think the best way is to get free data.
**Steve Maravelias:** Offer them, give them a list of 100 people and BE.
**Steve Maravelias:** Tell them to use it whatever they can.
**Steve Maravelias:** And then I think if they're like, listen, I'm giving you free data if you think it's bad.
**Steve Maravelias:** No, because that.
**Steve Maravelias:** That to me is the ultimate if somebody's going to offer me.
**Steve Maravelias:** But how much should I give them?
**Steve Maravelias:** 100?
**Steve Maravelias:** A thousand?

**Jon Kluger:** It's up to you.

**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah, I don't want to give them too little.
**Steve Maravelias:** I don't want to give them too much, but I guess.
**Steve Maravelias:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Well, I do have to run, Steve.

**Steve Maravelias:** All right, man.

**Jon Kluger:** Thank you.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, absolutely.
