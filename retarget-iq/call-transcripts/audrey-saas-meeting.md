## Transcript

**Alex Ciereszko:** Almost 25 years collecting data and analyzing data for financial advisors.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh man.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Just over to this.

**MyBPX Cloud:** A real nerd, a real geek.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Well, he's actually really cool.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's the good part.

**MyBPX Cloud:** That's why we has a personality.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's amazing.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh yeah, he's badass.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But let me go ahead and share my screen here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So now we can record this and I can actually.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Sounds good.

**Alex Ciereszko:** You'll be able to see how the dashboard looks.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.

**Alex Ciereszko:** This is a live account, Audrey.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So this is United Capital Source.
**Alex Ciereszko:** They are a capital funding company that uses US 9,600 users, as you can see here in the top left over the past week and 4700 of those people identified.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So this is part of the identification tool.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's going to show you exactly where your website visitors are coming from on sources.

**MyBPX Cloud:** What's, how do you drive?
**MyBPX Cloud:** I get all that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** How do you drive traffic to it?
**MyBPX Cloud:** What's the where, what's the traffic driver.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's what we're after.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I mean it's, it's up to your guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Marketing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you, if you're doing SEO, if you're doing paid ads, if you're in the SaaS space, I would 100 recommend doing something like Meta or Google Ads.
**Alex Ciereszko:** 1 million percent.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So this does not.
**MyBPX Cloud:** You can't go in there and let's say I'll give you a real life client situation.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So we have a guy that does bathroom B2B hotel and hospital bathroom refinishing surfaces for anti slip stuff and they're national and he wants to find, he wants, he wants the top 10 contacts at the top 150 hotel and hospital property management companies in the U.S. is.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That something you can get us in terms of lists?

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yep.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, well, it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Was there any specific keywords?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Audrey, could you help me find like a keyword along with that?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, so that would be bathroom refinishing.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I got, I got bathroom furnishings, accessories, remodeling, cleaning.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, remodeling.
**MyBPX Cloud:** But it's B2B.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**MyBPX Cloud:** And so it would be.

**Alex Ciereszko:** A bathroom installation for B2B.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So it's refurbishing.
**MyBPX Cloud:** It's a, it's part of the construction trade.
**MyBPX Cloud:** It's a very specific niche and he didn't believe that we could find them.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And I already found, I didn't give him the emails.
**MyBPX Cloud:** We already found a whole bunch of them and I, you know, now he's ghosting me a little turd.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Sorry, did I say that loud?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Sorry.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, you're good.

**MyBPX Cloud:** He's not listening, is he?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, sorry.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, where.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Where are you located?
**MyBPX Cloud:** What city is your headquarters?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, our company is in Wyoming, but I'm in Pennsylvania.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Trevor's in North Carolina.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We got partners in Vegas, Michigan, more North Carolina, Florida.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're all over the place.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so when you.
**MyBPX Cloud:** When you say you're in Wyoming.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so you've got a.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, got it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So you're.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So when you say partners, are you talking resellers?
**MyBPX Cloud:** There's.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Is that what you mean?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, no.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're really primarily working with the end consumer, Audrey.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, we do have resellers, but our focus is people like yourself.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Like, yeah, sure, you can resell it, but really we're focused on just the normal client.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So going directly to the person that's doing kitchen remodeling, bathroom remodeling, also people like you will 100% be able to help you guys out.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But we started working directly with the end user to ensure that they're getting good data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Because if they're not getting good data, you reselling it isn't going to do anything.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Right.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And we're putting it in as part of a package.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Actually, what we're doing with it, we're including it in a SaaS package.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's why we're kind of looking at the white label thing.
**MyBPX Cloud:** But we want to be able to give them, like, for one of our SAS packages, we want to be able to give them for free as part of the package.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Like.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Like, you know, a thousand leads a month, for example.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And if they want more, then we want to sell them at, you know, depending upon what the industry is, 25 a lead instead of if they went out to buy it at whatever.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Right.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Audrey, what I would suggest for something like that, like, for example, a very niche subject, just like this, February 15th is our approximate launch date for our V2 platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That platform is going to allow you to go in and pretty much search any term in the world and find who is Google.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Searching.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Searching that across the Internet.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's going to allow you to be able to do something like exactly what you're saying, to get very nitty gritty.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's going to take it a step further than our competition and other people that are doing this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's why we've been very busy in developing this for a while.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's going to allow you to get down to a very, very gritty, you know, molecular spot with searches.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** The other model we have, Alex, is we were able to set up nonprofits and build Chapters kind of like franchises, but to build chapters nationally, to do work all over the world.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**MyBPX Cloud:** And so we're able to.
**MyBPX Cloud:** One of the things we're really good at is creating like as we call it, a mothership back end, but you know, like a centralized hub and then to duplicate that process in different markets.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.

**MyBPX Cloud:** So we have some very specific things that we do that we've been doing for, you know, 25 years ourselves.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Right.

**MyBPX Cloud:** So, so what I'm thinking is, so what is the V2?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Is that just like the next generation of what you're doing?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh yeah, it's going to be this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** On steroids.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so is there like a webinar or something on the 15th?

**Alex Ciereszko:** We're, we're not doing a webinar, but we could certainly circle back.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I could reschedule a meeting right now with you that following week once it's released.

**MyBPX Cloud:** And what, what's the, what's the upgrade?
**MyBPX Cloud:** What, what's the difference between now and then?

**Alex Ciereszko:** The price?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Well, the price is going to be strictly 997amonth as opposed to the, you know, our quarterly grandfather didn't price it $500.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So any user before the 15th of February, we're going to grandfather them in at that 1500, you know, quarterly price.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And no matter what we do with the platform, it's going to stay that way for them.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so if we came in monthly at 749, we'd be at 749 as opposed to 997, correct?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so other than the price, what's the difference?
**MyBPX Cloud:** You said on steroids.
**MyBPX Cloud:** How.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Just generically not.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I don't want the secret sauce.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Just generically.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So even on our integrations tab here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So for example, when I go in to connect to high level Google Ads, Meta Salesforce, any of these connections, or my Slack channels or my mailchimp, these are going to be a whole lot easier to connect.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're also planning on upgrading all search terms.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you're going to be able to say, you know, best kitchen remodeling near me and actually see who's locally searching that in your area showing intent.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're also going to be adding, I mean, pretty much infinite amounts of topics.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So just like the topic you just mentioned with those special anti slip bathrooms, that's something that we can add.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Secondly, the actual search.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So when you go in to create an audience, this is going to be lightning fast.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The AI assistant is going to be fully complete, so you can actually just type in a query just like you would chatgpt and it'll spit that list out.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Every email is going to be validated monthly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So all the emails on our data and our identity graph are going to be completely cleaned.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The phone numbers are also going to be cleaned.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're going to be showing approximate credit ranges.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm trying to think the overall platform is going to be cleaned up as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean, this is a very simple platform, but we're just going to make it a whole lot nicer and easier to use.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then we're also working on a cold email integration.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So when you pull your lists, you're gonna be automatically able to pull all that information and cold email people.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so we're also using, for the MyBPX we're using, and I don't tell this to most people, but clients don't know it, but we're using a white label ghl.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So because we've got other stuff that we do that's beyond them.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So because we're looking at ERP as well as CRM and then we've got the foundation piece, which is another piece altogether.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So anyway, that's what we're building over here.
**MyBPX Cloud:** But the lead gen piece has been really annoying just because we want to give them high quality.
**MyBPX Cloud:** There's nothing worse than buying something from 411 and it's like, you know, crap.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And everybody else is calling them.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Right?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** What else you want to show me?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, so you have your list builder that's both B2B, that's static.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You also your static list as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So if you just want to search on people in certain job positions, if you want to search on homeowners or non homeowners, you can do that as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** These lists are unlimited, Audrey.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So when you go into all audiences, you can sit here and pull these lists every single day and this is what they look like.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't know which audience this was.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We use this as a demo.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So there's a ton of.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But, oh, this is marketing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** People interested in marketing.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This is what this list looks like.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Personal email, mobile number, first name, last name, any associated personal or direct lines, their addresses as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Job titles, business emails, LinkedIn's company names, revenues, income ranges, net worths.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That is all in here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And you can filter by all these categories as well.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, people over the.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This in this income homeowners, non homeowners, married, non married, specific states, specific zip codes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It gives you a bunch of variabilities to be able to actually Search through these lists.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Quick question.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Thanks for that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I appreciate it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Quick question.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Is there, is the platform also.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Like, do people send emails from that?
**MyBPX Cloud:** I, I got a little bit confused with the audience lab stuff.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I still didn't figure it out.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Like what we want to do with it is we want to export it from there, import it into the client's sub account, if you will.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Right.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And, and then have it go into the workflows from there.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Right, Specifically.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Right.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So, but is there an email function or something?
**MyBPX Cloud:** What else?
**MyBPX Cloud:** What are the other functions of your retarget iq?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Why is it called retarget?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Because we also work with retargeting and banner ads and real time bidding and stuff.
**MyBPX Cloud:** We have platforms for that as well.
**MyBPX Cloud:** How does that compare to that?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I mean this is really the foolproof way of reducing your costs with advertising and increasing your link clicks, your ctrs.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Andre, if it was me, I mean the number one thing I'm recommending to people is run this for your Facebook and Google Ads.
**Alex Ciereszko:** This stuff, every single person that signs up and uses it for advertising.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I have a video.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can, you can even see it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's right here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So this was, this was a call I had.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I think it was just yesterday.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I was on this meeting.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let me open this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There we go.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And I'm just gonna scroll here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So this was a gentleman who, his wife is in firearms sales and stuff like that.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you look right where my mouse is, their original lead cost was $1.75.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Within 48 hours of using our intent lists for, you know, high net worth women that are interested in firearms, their lead costs dropped to only a dollar.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you're spending a hundred thousand dollars a year on meta, you are reducing your bill to about 60 grand for the same amount of intent and power and leads.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If we go over a little bit, we're also going to see that his CTR used to be just under 7% and now it's just about 13%.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It doubled.

**MyBPX Cloud:** So the click through is going real well.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, got it.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And this is happening.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, to first answer your question about the emails, I always, excuse me.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I always tell people if you're going in and you're doing something with emails, please use something like Million verifier.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Clean those emails, make sure they're validated.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We can only do so much with our emails.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you want to ensure, you know, foolproof cold email, clean it up with something like Million verifier.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That is part of the reason we are releasing email validation in the Next two, three weeks here to be able to clean those emails even more.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But I have people who come in here and they use these lists, they never clean them and they're getting amazing response rates from cold email and no problems.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But I just give it as a fair warning.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Clean the emails with something like million verifier.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I have to tell you that.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, well, yeah, because you got to warm up the list and I get all that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So we understand how that all works.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So now audience lab says that things are triple verified.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So what is.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's what you're talking about, right?
**MyBPX Cloud:** If it's triple verified, then it's already been scrubbed, right?
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's correct, yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So you guys are adding that like February 15th.

**Alex Ciereszko:** It's already added.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We're just going to be doing it on a more routine basis.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So they are.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes, that's correct, to answer your question.

**MyBPX Cloud:** So are they scrubbed when you get them or you're saying we would have to have an additional scrubber?

**Alex Ciereszko:** I currently, I recommend to use an additional scrubber because we have hundreds of millions of emails at this point, Audrey.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So I can't guarantee all of them are the most accurate and up to date.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But that is why on February 15, when we release this new platform, we are planning on making sure that it is spic and span and those emails are perfect.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Got it?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** All right.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** What else do you want me to know?

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's about it, Audrey.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean, you're getting unlimited data.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You're getting unlimited data enrichment and you're getting unlimited website visitor identification.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I don't care if you guys get one person, your landing page or 100 million, we can identify those people.

**MyBPX Cloud:** So when you identify them, do they then like transition into like a contact and get auto loaded up into the client portal?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, absolutely.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So they all appear as in the visitor identification section with their names, emails and any associated.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can also signify.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Hey, I only want people who have a visible LinkedIn, but it will try to match their LinkedIn, which in some cases it does, or integrated with something like your salesforce, your high level.
**Alex Ciereszko:** For you, it'll be high level.
**Alex Ciereszko:** These will automatically come in as contacts.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so is there an extra charge for that integration?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, no, this is all included.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so right now, right now, if and if we don't give the client access to it, the white label is not a big deal, right in getting started.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, I would say what we always tell people is, hey, start on a quarterly plan because everybody.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Look, Audrey, I'm not doubting you, but I'M just saying everybody has thinks that they can sell this stuff and they're going to have 100 clients tomorrow.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.
**Alex Ciereszko:** There's realistically no reason for you to be signing up for a white label right now.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I would get a quarterly package, play with it, learn the tool, get some people on internally, and then say, hey, Alex, like, people are loving this, or, hey, I love that you guys improved X, Y and Z.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Let's go and work on a white label now because we really understand this platform.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You really.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you're not putting this client facing, you do not need to.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And even if you did, you can say, hey, we're in partnership with Retarget iq.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But realistically, right now, you do not need to sign up for a white label with one person.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You know what I mean?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Unless it is client facing.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And so, I mean, basically, we would.
**MyBPX Cloud:** We sell it with our spin on it anyway, because it's a My BPX service and nobody needs to know what it is on the back end.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Exactly.

**MyBPX Cloud:** You know?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, well, that's.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's cool.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And then you can.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So with the five pixels, because I think we can sell five clients pretty easily.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Any additional pixel that you add is going to be $10.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So your sixth one.
**Alex Ciereszko:** 10 bucks.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Seventh one, 20 bucks.

**MyBPX Cloud:** A month.

**Alex Ciereszko:** A month?
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.

**MyBPX Cloud:** But they're 100.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Because of the white label.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's what you're paying for is you're paying for that branding.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You're paying for the seat and everything.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's a lot harder to put together a white label.
**Alex Ciereszko:** A lot of people just slap a new sticker on it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's a little bit more difficult than us just doing that internally.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, no, I got.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, I know what that takes.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** How many partners are.
**MyBPX Cloud:** How many people own your company?
**MyBPX Cloud:** You're privately held?

**Alex Ciereszko:** We are, yes.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Mm.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Well, congrats on that.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Thank you.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Where's my button?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, here it is.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Hold on.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Was easy.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, my.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I wish it was, Audrey.

**MyBPX Cloud:** I know.
**MyBPX Cloud:** It's really hard.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I got it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, I know.
**MyBPX Cloud:** This stuff is driving me crazy.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I got it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So unlimited contacts, not the 5 million like the audience lab said, right?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes, ma'.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Am.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Alex, what is your last name?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Chereschko.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's Polish.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Say that again.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Chereschko.

**MyBPX Cloud:** How do you spell that?

**Alex Ciereszko:** C, I, E, R, E, S, Z.

**MyBPX Cloud:** K. Oh, that is Polish.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** My last name is Talkington.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I talk for a living.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I know.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I realized my.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I don't have my zoom background on my phone.
**MyBPX Cloud:** You can see all the mess behind me.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so the integration.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so when you set up, how long does it take to set up a new.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I'll say a new user with the pixel and everything?
**MyBPX Cloud:** How long and do we.
**MyBPX Cloud:** What kind of support do we get for that?
**MyBPX Cloud:** 749amonth.

**Alex Ciereszko:** So that's going to be all via Slack and Loom video.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you shoot us a message in Slack.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We try to get back to you guys in a very timely manner.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's 100% sub.
**Alex Ciereszko:** 24 hours on Slack.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you shoot us a message, say, hey, I'm experiencing this.
**Alex Ciereszko:** In this issue, usually, I mean, you can.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can expect a response within five minutes to two hours or so.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, how long does it take to set up a new client?

**Alex Ciereszko:** I could probably do it in 45 seconds.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Do you want to test it?
**Alex Ciereszko:** I can drop a payment link for you and we can do it.

**MyBPX Cloud:** You can do what?

**Alex Ciereszko:** I was going to say I can drop a payment link for you and we can test how quick it takes to set you up.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll time it for you, Audrey.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, that's good.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I like that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I'm going to use that.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's good.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Let me drop you a payment link.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, my God.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's worth gold right there.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, my gosh.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Which card do you want to put that on?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Right.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Right?

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I got to talk to my CEO.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I'm the gatekeeper here.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** But no, I like that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's good.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Payment.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Look, and we get you set up right now.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Get you set up right now.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Set up right now.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Take notes on that one, Trevor.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's a good.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** And in case your cards don't work, too, we take Amazon pay, so we make it really easy for you.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Isn't this fun?
**MyBPX Cloud:** It's so fun.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I know, right?
**MyBPX Cloud:** I know.
**MyBPX Cloud:** It's so fun.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I always tell.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I can always tell if, you know, when people are, like, holding their breath and they're, you know, they have all this sales resistance and it's, you know, it's really fun to play with them.
**MyBPX Cloud:** This one guy said, you know, I'm really not interested right now.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And I said, you're not interesting.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I'm finding you fascinating.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So, I mean, it's really fun.
**MyBPX Cloud:** But, you know, I can test it now with your payment link.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Just, you know, I can get you set up right now.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I like that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's great.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Thank you.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, let me do this.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So when we.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so when.
**MyBPX Cloud:** The reason I'm asking is because do we do the setup when we add a person.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, it's very easy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So all you would do is go over to your websites and then you just click add website and then put in their URL, their company name, and then any UTM filters you'd like to utilize as well.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so that's it, huh?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, that's literally it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And it's going to start firing and then all you have to do is use this dropdown and it'll show you each individual site here.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Audrey.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So you want to go to ucs, you click on them.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you want to go to Audrey SAS product, you click on them.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You click on Trevor's product, you, you know, click through whichever one you'd like and it's going to open a new page for you and show you exactly how many site visitors and who's been identified.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so.
**MyBPX Cloud:** But we still have to drive traffic to the site, right?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Right, yeah, that would be on you guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** We don't handle any marketing, unfortunately.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, okay, I got it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Because right now, when we do our RTB with the banner ad, we're able to then from that, then clip it and it automatically lands into, you know, into the CRM and then the workflows automation begins.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And so the tr.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, I see how that could work with that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** The traffic, But then the audiences.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so what happens?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Let's say we do an audience of.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Let's say we, I don't know, export and import or trigger, whatever your word is.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Like say 5,000 contacts for a client and they.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Is it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Is it all set up with the compliance?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Like, if we're doing, you know, We've got the A2P for the texting or whatever, we can decide you.
**MyBPX Cloud:** We do what we do with it, right?
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I mean, it's solely up to you guys.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I always tell people, you know, be responsible.
**Alex Ciereszko:** TCPA laws don't get in a lawsuit.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But it's up to you guys, you know?

**MyBPX Cloud:** Right, right.

**Alex Ciereszko:** You know, I'm not going to recommend whether you guys should or shouldn't text numbers.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I always tell people, you know, market and utilize it for cold email.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But if you guys would like to, you know, there are people who utilize it for cold texting and cold calling.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And is it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Is it in a CSV format?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Is that how it gets.

**Alex Ciereszko:** That's correct.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you want to export it, it's going to be CSV.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then February 15th, we're also adding the.
**Alex Ciereszko:** The Google Sheets feature so it can directly export to your Google Sheets.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, got it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** All right, well, listen, I'm going to meet with my CEO in the morning.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.

**MyBPX Cloud:** And I'll tell him about it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And then I'm also looking at one more portal.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, I like you guys.
**MyBPX Cloud:** You're.
**MyBPX Cloud:** You're.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I. I like you guys.
**MyBPX Cloud:** You guys are you.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Trevor, you really should not dominate the conversation.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh, I know, right?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's crazy.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** You came into this guns blazing and very confident.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Good for you.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Thank you.

**MyBPX Cloud:** I hope this is your last call of the day.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Is it?

**Alex Ciereszko:** It is.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's seven o' clock here on the east coast.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, got it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, well, I hope you stay out of that storm there, Trevor.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, yes.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Well, thank you.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, my gosh.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.

**Trevor Cox:** Oh, yeah.

**MyBPX Cloud:** I'm gonna stay out of Minneapolis so I stay alive and nobody kills me.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So there you go.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Absolutely.

**MyBPX Cloud:** I'm not protesting.

**Alex Ciereszko:** No, exactly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You can't be stupid, right?

**MyBPX Cloud:** No, I mean, why?
**MyBPX Cloud:** Geez, you know, it's hard enough to stay alive, let alone put yourself in there, you know, Gee whiz.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Um, anyway, okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** You guys have been really great.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I appreciate it.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Absolutely.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So.
**MyBPX Cloud:** You're going to send me a copy of this, right?
**MyBPX Cloud:** So I can review it because I can't really see anything on my phone.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll.
**Alex Ciereszko:** I'll email it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Email it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And then since it's going to be easier for you in that email since you're already there, probably reviewing the call, if you guys do end up wanting to purchase after the call, you'll see two different payment links.
**Alex Ciereszko:** So there's going to be one for the monthly and then one for the quarterly.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Audrey, all in one email for you.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, got it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And so then when we add a client, it's only ten bucks after five.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yes, that's correct, after five.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So five is included in 749 if we do it monthly.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes, ma'.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Am.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Unlimited data, unlimited website resolution, 5 pixels, and unlimited data enrichment.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you want to send us a list of 100 records to enrich, great.
**Alex Ciereszko:** If you want to send us a million records to enrich, Great.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Either.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So one more thing about that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So we have a guy with like a hundred thousand, you know, that he's been sitting on.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's different than scrubbing, right?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, we call it enrichment.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But if you want mobile numbers for them, personal emails, company names, like filling in all the.

**MyBPX Cloud:** All the.
**MyBPX Cloud:** All the empty stuff.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes, ma'.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Am.

**MyBPX Cloud:** And so there's no extra charge for that enrichment?

**Alex Ciereszko:** No, ma'.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Am.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I've graduated to mam.
**MyBPX Cloud:** How did that happen?

**Alex Ciereszko:** I'm just being Respectful.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, I appreciate that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Thank you.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That means I've done a good job of being a student over here.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I'm excited.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I've had a really good day.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, my goodness.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Well, that's pretty cool because that's a very valuable service when they have these, you know, messy situations, which they all do.

**Alex Ciereszko:** I agree.

**MyBPX Cloud:** What a mess out here, huh?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Oh, yeah.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, tell me about the AI.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Tell me about the AI thing.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And that's my last question.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yeah, it's been in beta mode, so we're just testing it.
**Alex Ciereszko:** But, you know, let's say you guys want to make a list on the fly and you don't want to be making a whole bunch of rules.
**Alex Ciereszko:** You just basically go into that AI bot and you go in and say, you know, please pull me a list of B2C users that are interested in kitchen remodeling in the 18036 zip code that are homeowners and making over six figures a year.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Boom.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And that's going to run that list for you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Instead of you sitting there and saying, hey, you know, rule is equal to homeowner or probable homeowner.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Rule is equal to, you know, not that that's hard, Audrey, because you can hop on here for 15 minutes and you'll have a really good grip on it, but it just makes it easier.
**Alex Ciereszko:** It's like talking to ChatGPT at that point, but just for data.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Got it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So once we.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, we're.
**MyBPX Cloud:** We're all getting really good at prompting, right?
**MyBPX Cloud:** I think we're really.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, yeah.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Viva la prompt.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, I love that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's good.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Well, let me write that down.
**MyBPX Cloud:** That's a good sound.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I can see a thing coming up.
**MyBPX Cloud:** The villa prompt.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, for my French speaking.
**MyBPX Cloud:** French.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, got it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, so.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So that.
**MyBPX Cloud:** So, for example, we have another client who is, you know, with houses, people in certain zip codes who.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Houses are at least 20 years old and that they would be likely for, you know, reroofing type thing.

**Alex Ciereszko:** You could certainly do that.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** For that kind of like with our new terms, Audrey, you could go in and basically just say, hey, you know, people, you know, best roof or near me or how to fix roof damage, for example.
**Alex Ciereszko:** And that will pull those people looking for that specific topic.

**MyBPX Cloud:** And so everybody now in all of these storm ravaged areas, you know, all the, all the storm chasers are down there and they're, you know, like getting into it, right?

**Alex Ciereszko:** Yes, exactly.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I'm good.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.

**MyBPX Cloud:** I don't know what your demo was, but I enjoyed you guys you guys were great.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Oh, yeah.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Well, thank you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Enjoy.
**Alex Ciereszko:** That's all that matters.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Yeah, Right on.
**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay, thanks a lot.
**MyBPX Cloud:** I appreciate it.
**MyBPX Cloud:** And I will follow up.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Sounds good.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Audrey.

**MyBPX Cloud:** I'll get that email.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Email over to you.
**Alex Ciereszko:** Okay.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Okay.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Nice job.

**Alex Ciereszko:** Awesome.

**MyBPX Cloud:** Well, thank you.
