## Transcript

**Jon Kluger:** I. I loved going to games, but they took too long because I was young.
**Jon Kluger:** I felt like 4 hours, 5 hours for some games.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Now I'm old enough to be.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, I'm plenty old enough.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm almost 30, just to be clear.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm old enough to actually drink at the games.
**Jon Kluger:** And they got the damn pit box.
**Jon Kluger:** And I get it, and I start drinking my beers, and by my third beer, it's the seventh inning, and I haven't even caught a buzz.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** I finally understood when I hit a certain age, baseball games are just an excuse to day drink with your boys and watch sports.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** And I was like.
**Jon Kluger:** I was like.
**Jon Kluger:** I remember going with my dad to Camden Yards.
**Jon Kluger:** He'd buy a bag of pistachios this big outside the stadium and just sit there the whole game just eating them.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I. I am a. I love a good pitching duel more than the way it is today on home runs.
**G Darrell Rigley:** You know, I mean, I enjoyed home runs, obviously, but I love a good pitching duel.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I grew up with no fighting for.

**Jon Kluger:** Tickets like Shohei Otani hitting bombs.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what.
**Jon Kluger:** That's what it all is.
**Jon Kluger:** It's all commoditized at this point of the love of the game.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** I. I completely get it.
**Jon Kluger:** Trust me.
**Jon Kluger:** It's just like, I'm a big golfer, and all the stuff that they've been doing with golf where they're.
**Jon Kluger:** They're altering courses, they're making them longer, they're doing this, they're doing that, and I'm just like, at the end of the day, if the technology is moving too fast, limit the technology and leave it be for everybody else.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, I don't want to go play a PGA golf course if I get the chance and have to hit a freaking wood into every part.
**Jon Kluger:** 4.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, how is that fair to little old me?

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Well, Daryl, I appreciate you taking the time today at a chance to take a peek at your website.
**Jon Kluger:** What I always like to do on these calls is kind of kick things off, learn a little bit more about you in your business, and then I can kind of cater our demo exactly to that.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay, sounds good.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Sounds good.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I. I've owned a marketing agency, both B2B and B2C for probably 25 years.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I worked from home before working from home was popular.

**Jon Kluger:** There we go.

**G Darrell Rigley:** When the only.
**G Darrell Rigley:** The fastest way to do business was FedEx or a fax that went in, in, in.

**Jon Kluger:** In those ruining my.
**Jon Kluger:** My Internet days where a fax or a phone call came in and all of a sudden everything Shuts down.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, Yeah.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I re.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I had an agency, a digital marketing agency that I shut, literally shut down about two and a half years ago.
**G Darrell Rigley:** And I did it one, for two reasons.
**G Darrell Rigley:** One, my, myself and my little morky who's on the bed over there, 11 pound mory.
**G Darrell Rigley:** We were attacked by two pit bulls.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

**G Darrell Rigley:** And I was literally out of commission.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I couldn't walk from the door that you see in the back to the other side of the room without hitting the floor.

**Jon Kluger:** So sorry.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Literally just in.
**G Darrell Rigley:** And it took me over a year of therapy on my own to get back to where I could walk.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I gained a lot of weight.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I, in fact, I lost 60 pounds when I started working out again.

**Jon Kluger:** Congrats.
**Jon Kluger:** That's awesome.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I've, I've recovered, but I, I let it go because I figured out real quickly.

**Jon Kluger:** I didn't.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I hated it.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Websites, all angles, hated it.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I hooked up with a guy named Tommy Leontano.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I don't know whether you know him or not.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm not familiar.
**Jon Kluger:** No.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**G Darrell Rigley:** He was selling Site Visitor and I was, I was enamored with the technology of that.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I just thought that was so cool.
**G Darrell Rigley:** And I sold some of that.
**G Darrell Rigley:** He also was selling data.
**G Darrell Rigley:** But I, at that time, I ended up having my accident and so I literally just shut down.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Well, I've been married 49 years.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Got divorced.

**Jon Kluger:** Sorry.

**G Darrell Rigley:** My wife came out of the bedroom and said she wanted a divorce.

**Jon Kluger:** And.

**G Darrell Rigley:** So we're, we're divorced.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I'm still living in the house that I shared with her and she, she made a deal with me that I could stay until I got a business up and running.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Understand?
**G Darrell Rigley:** I said, well, I went out trying to look for a job and man, there was nothing out there that I ever wanted to do.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Once you own your own business and your own deal, you can't work for other people.
**G Darrell Rigley:** But.
**G Darrell Rigley:** So anyway, I decided to start an agency and I wanted to, I wanted to do as much automation as I could with it.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I wanted it to be hands off as much as I could.
**G Darrell Rigley:** And I wanted to be very simple.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Site visitor and data.
**G Darrell Rigley:** That's where I, I don't want to do bulk email.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I don't want to do anything else but that.
**G Darrell Rigley:** So I have a website that's built.
**G Darrell Rigley:** It's not, it's 90 done.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I have videos, welcome videos explaining the product, all that stuff.
**G Darrell Rigley:** And these are actually in the.
**G Darrell Rigley:** With the designer now who's doing the spokesperson and all that kind of stuff that's in construction.
**G Darrell Rigley:** My ghl is in construction and my landing pages are in construction.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Probably the only thing that's going to keep us from being ready to launch in like 14 days is SMS getting that all set up.

**Jon Kluger:** Do you have a partner in that?
**Jon Kluger:** We have preferred partners that we can refer to you and I have all.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I have all that set up.

**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** So I looked at and I've known these guys for a number of years because they were in competitors with Tommy and Brent Mueller who I sold Site Visitor for Audience Lab.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I saw your ad on Facebook and here we are today.

**Jon Kluger:** Wonderful.
**Jon Kluger:** So I think the data works because guess what?
**Jon Kluger:** The data works because we used intent data on people that are researching Audience Lab to run our ads.
**Jon Kluger:** So just to testify on the quality of our data.

**G Darrell Rigley:** That's what I want to hear.
**G Darrell Rigley:** It works.

**Jon Kluger:** It's, it's great.
**Jon Kluger:** It's actually, we have a perfect opportunity.
**Jon Kluger:** The question that I have for you is when you look at Website Visitor in the data, are you looking to have a white label platform where your clients can go in and get the data or are you looking to be able to deliver them the data while also looking at the website tracking?

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah, I was looking when I talked with Audience Lab, I the only, I asked them the question because on the, I'm going to offer, I'm going to lead with both, but then I'm going to do a quiz with them on are they what they're spending on ads and if they're not spending much money on ads, I'm going to transition right to Site Visitor and I ask them, can I deliver that?
**G Darrell Rigley:** Can that be automated?
**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Send them the, the pixel with instructions and off to the races.
**G Darrell Rigley:** They said yeah, we can do that on the data.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I have not really decided because I haven't had that conversation yet.

**Jon Kluger:** That's fair.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I am using AI.

**Jon Kluger:** Bots.

**G Darrell Rigley:** But conversation with the product, with the client.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I hired them and they're, they're putting that all together for me as well.
**G Darrell Rigley:** And I was amazed, having not been in the, in the business for a year, two years, how well the conversation on this stuff has really improved.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I didn't know I was talking to somebody.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I thought I was talking to somebody.
**G Darrell Rigley:** They were that good.

**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I hired them like now.
**G Darrell Rigley:** And so we're building out, we're building out the conversation and how it goes.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I had a five minute conversation with them and, and they kept asking me questions and I'm giving them all the objections how to, how to, how to overcome questions on Site Visitor and it was amazing.
**G Darrell Rigley:** So Now I have to do it on a data.
**G Darrell Rigley:** But again, that's why I'm having a conversation with you.

**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** So, Darrell, I've got.
**Jon Kluger:** I've got the exact thing that I think would be the perfect fit for you to start.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is we have a white label offering right now.
**Jon Kluger:** As you scale your business, I don't think you need it right away.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is the white label is going to cost you at least three grand a month.
**Jon Kluger:** What I think, what I think the better option is is we have a single license where you have access to all of the data.
**Jon Kluger:** It comes with five pixels for tracking, website tracking, and any additional Pixel is just $50.
**Jon Kluger:** So when you hit the threshold where you need the data and you want to sell access to the platform and running ads through the platform and doing all of that, you come and you tell me, and we can work out a plan to give you additional licenses to set up for those clients.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Now, I don't.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't want to prescribe you $1500 where you're going to use $500 worth of stuff.
**Jon Kluger:** It's.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't play that game.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm a transparent guy.
**Jon Kluger:** My grandfather used to own his own shoe company where he would fly to China and write a check in the 60s for a million dollars to buy all of the shoes on a handshake agreement.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, your word is your bond.
**Jon Kluger:** And if I come here and I upsell you out the butt, yeah, maybe I get paid more, but you're going to be upset, and I don't rock with that.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm the Chief Revenue officer for a reason, and that's because I believe in good business.
**Jon Kluger:** With that being said, I'll show you the platform.
**Jon Kluger:** Depending on how many pixels you have or you need, you can always upgrade.
**Jon Kluger:** So we start you with five.
**Jon Kluger:** If you already have 10 clients, let's say we can throw in and we can add the additional five.
**Jon Kluger:** But.

**G Darrell Rigley:** So I start out with five pixels and the data, how do I start on that?
**G Darrell Rigley:** Where do I start?

**Jon Kluger:** Included?
**Jon Kluger:** So building audiences, like Audience Lab has, you get unlimited audiences and unlimited lead lists.
**Jon Kluger:** So.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you're literally just building the data list for someone and passing it over to them, you don't need a bunch of licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** You only need one.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Do you have audiences already built?

**Jon Kluger:** So we have intent categories already built and the intent categories.
**Jon Kluger:** All you have to do.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll show you real quick.
**Jon Kluger:** It's fairly simple.
**Jon Kluger:** We always have support available for you.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you Say you wanted white glove support.
**Jon Kluger:** You can purchase it for an additional 249amonth.
**Jon Kluger:** That means anyone will come on a call with you whenever you need it and they'll guide you through it.
**Jon Kluger:** Our standard level of support is you just make a video a loom video is what we recommend of your screen saying, hey, this is the issue I have.
**Jon Kluger:** How do I fix it?
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, that over to us and we instantly resolve it for you.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** All right.
**G Darrell Rigley:** So in terms of, I have a guy that I hired off of upwork.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I've done upwork and fiverr outsourcing for years.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I've had call centers and all that, all outsourced.
**G Darrell Rigley:** But I, I hired a guy that is a data data expert for me to help me with data.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I wasn't sure if I needed him, but I wanted, when I hired him, he was GHL expert, but he also dealt with data.
**G Darrell Rigley:** So I may include him in helping build out audiences 100, no problem.

**Jon Kluger:** This is being recorded right now too, Daryl.
**Jon Kluger:** So the firefly right here in the middle, it's going to send you a copy of the video and the transcript.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you wanted to share it with him and say, hey, this is the tool that I want to use to be able to discover audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** You only you can have the same login.
**Jon Kluger:** You guys can share the login.
**Jon Kluger:** We don't, we don't set caps on your login people and he go into the platform and be able to do things for you.
**Jon Kluger:** Because once an audience is built, you can constantly refresh it to ensure that the new intent data comes in.
**Jon Kluger:** So once you build it, once, it's basically that's all you need to do.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so first things first.
**Jon Kluger:** This is the website up here on the left.
**Jon Kluger:** What you'll see is a little dropdown.
**Jon Kluger:** For each pixel that you set up, you'll have an additional dropdown.
**Jon Kluger:** So right now this is a client that only has one website.
**Jon Kluger:** But for you, if you had five, it would show five different options that you could toggle between.
**Jon Kluger:** The first thing you're going to see is the identification rate.
**Jon Kluger:** Right now we're identifying almost 50% of website visitors.
**Jon Kluger:** Our standard range is between 40 and 70% depending on the permissions required on the website.
**Jon Kluger:** If the website says you have to accept cookies to move forward and they accept cookies, we have a much higher chance of identifying them than if it's a website where you land, you give no permissions, and you leave.
**Jon Kluger:** With that being said, what you can see on this dashboard right away is the top pages the top places it's coming from and the top cities.
**Jon Kluger:** What I really like is the visual.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say we want to look at for Dallas, Fort Worth right now, you see it as a single instance on the map.
**Jon Kluger:** But as we start to zoom in, you'll see the, the, the area of your website visitors begins to expand and get more specific.
**Jon Kluger:** I like to highlight this because imagine you have an office in Dallas and now you're considering where to open the next one.
**Jon Kluger:** Well, there's more traffic in Fort Worth than there is Dallas.
**Jon Kluger:** That might be a good indicator.
**Jon Kluger:** So just having this visual representation is really nice for clients.
**Jon Kluger:** In terms of the data that we actually pull on a client by client basis, what you'll see right off the bat is email and address.
**Jon Kluger:** If we scroll to the right, which it's not letting me do right now for some reason because it hates me.
**Jon Kluger:** If we scroll to the right, you'll also be able to see the detailed financials, their address, their demographic breakdown, their contact information, their device id, their behaviors across the Internet quite extensively.
**Jon Kluger:** And even if they own a vehicle or a property.
**Jon Kluger:** So all of these can be pulled just by website visitor information.
**Jon Kluger:** So it's pretty dang powerful.
**Jon Kluger:** Now you might ask, well, this seems complex.
**Jon Kluger:** How do I do it?
**Jon Kluger:** We go to websites.
**Jon Kluger:** Here you simply click add website.
**Jon Kluger:** You put in the information, you add any filters that you want to filter out and then you hit save.
**Jon Kluger:** And just like that, you'll be able to then place the pixel on the website.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay, so this is where you build the pixel.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so you build the pixel, you place it on the website.
**Jon Kluger:** Once you place it on the website, you start getting a feed like this.
**Jon Kluger:** You also get deep analytics so we can look at the audience by age, gender, what device they're looking at it on, where it's coming from, their income and when V2 releases.
**Jon Kluger:** So we're releasing the second version, updated version of our platform come February 15th when V2 is released.
**Jon Kluger:** This will be even more extensive.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**G Darrell Rigley:** By the way, are you giving access to your clients to, to look at this?
**G Darrell Rigley:** Do they have their own portal to look at it or so delivering the pixel and the leads to their CRM.

**Jon Kluger:** So we will be typically recommend for your setup.
**Jon Kluger:** If you wanted to integrate directly into their CRM, you would want to have to go down the white label path.
**Jon Kluger:** If you want to get your feet wet early and try to get the first baseline to get things set up before you roll it out, we can set it up differently.
**Jon Kluger:** V2 will have the ability to add additional integrations.
**Jon Kluger:** What the challenge is right now is the V1 platform only allows one integration per platform.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you have five clients on go high level until February 15th, you can't have multiple connectors.
**Jon Kluger:** Come February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** You could have multiple Go High Levels, but each additional Go High Level is an additional $50.
**Jon Kluger:** I mentioned that because we won't.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I mean, we won't be ready by February 15th, so you don't need to.

**Jon Kluger:** You don't need to stress.
**Jon Kluger:** When we cross that bridge, Darrell, we'll be able to work things out.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that was.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry, Cal.
**Jon Kluger:** Rip.
**Jon Kluger:** It was barking.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason I mentioned that is what you need is just this 500 package right now.
**Jon Kluger:** You would just need this.
**Jon Kluger:** One moment.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm gonna tell my dog to stop barking.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Good luck.

**Jon Kluger:** Hey, buddy.
**Jon Kluger:** You come sit with me.

**G Darrell Rigley:** You okay?

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** There was actually someone there, so he did a good job.
**Jon Kluger:** What.
**Jon Kluger:** What I'm.
**Jon Kluger:** What I'm explaining is if we did a white label, which would allow for you to do that plug in, everyone has their own instance.
**Jon Kluger:** They get access to the data, they get access to the pixel, they get access to everything.
**Jon Kluger:** Huh.
**Jon Kluger:** It's getting a lot more expensive.
**Jon Kluger:** If we have it set up where we start you here.
**Jon Kluger:** And then as needs arise, we can work out how.
**Jon Kluger:** How we need to add additional licenses, how we need to position this that best economically suits you.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll do that.
**Jon Kluger:** I just don't want to over prescribe early where for the first three months, you're paying an extra $2500 a month on something that you don't need.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Right.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I. I mean, I understand what you're.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I understand what you're saying.
**G Darrell Rigley:** What is the cost starting out to do what you're talking about?

**Jon Kluger:** For me, this is just 500.
**Jon Kluger:** If you agree a month.
**Jon Kluger:** If you agree to do a quarterly with us, Quarterly just means you pay fifteen hundred dollars up front and you get it for three months.
**Jon Kluger:** You're locked in at that price forever.
**Jon Kluger:** If you choose to upgrade, you get to upgrade off of this pricing because you're a grandfathered in member.
**Jon Kluger:** So if you join it, you won, you get.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I can't see the pricing.
**G Darrell Rigley:** It's so small.

**Jon Kluger:** You can.

**G Darrell Rigley:** You can send that to me though.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Or you can actually send this video to me.

**Jon Kluger:** That.
**Jon Kluger:** That'd be okay to see it on the video.
**Jon Kluger:** So what you can see is we'll have you in at 500.
**Jon Kluger:** The issue is, is white label starts at 3650, and that's because it comes with 10 licenses.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't think you need that right now.
**Jon Kluger:** No, not at all.
**Jon Kluger:** You really only need a single license, which includes five of the super pixels.
**Jon Kluger:** And if you need any additional pixels, let's say you need another five.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, it'll just be five times five, which would be 250.
**Jon Kluger:** And this math isn't.
**Jon Kluger:** This math isn't right.
**Jon Kluger:** It should be 250.
**Jon Kluger:** This should be $750.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry, I have to figure out why my formulas are acting up.
**Jon Kluger:** That being said.
**Jon Kluger:** Oh, I know what I did wrong.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry.
**Jon Kluger:** My Excel brain is going off.
**Jon Kluger:** What?
**Jon Kluger:** All you need right now is a $500 package that will give you access to the visitor information for up to five websites.
**Jon Kluger:** If you need to deliver that information to your clients, you can easily just export it and send it over.
**Jon Kluger:** They upload it into their.
**Jon Kluger:** Go high level.
**Jon Kluger:** It'll work.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** All right.
**Jon Kluger:** No problems there.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** In terms of the audiences, the thing that's going to make us very different between Audience Lab and ourselves is we allow for unlimited audiences.
**Jon Kluger:** Not only that, we allow for unlimited records.
**Jon Kluger:** If you look at yesterday or two days ago, there's about 3.5 million in records pulled in just three hours.
**Jon Kluger:** Audience Lab will cap you at the number of audiences, typically 2 to 4, depending on your initial package.
**Jon Kluger:** And they'll limit the number of leads that you can have.
**Jon Kluger:** Overall, we don't believe in that.
**Jon Kluger:** We believe you should have access to the data.
**Jon Kluger:** You should be able to look, explore, test, what have you.
**Jon Kluger:** Now, when it comes to building an audience, you have ignore advanced search.
**Jon Kluger:** Advanced search is more so no intent data.
**Jon Kluger:** Advanced search is just, I want to find CEOs of mechanical engineering companies that have more than 50 employees that can be used for targeting.
**Jon Kluger:** But what you want to target on is intent data.
**Jon Kluger:** Right?
**Jon Kluger:** Intent data.
**Jon Kluger:** I always just translate as is buying signs you're researching.
**Jon Kluger:** If I'm researching a car, I'm probably researching it because I'm going to buy it.
**Jon Kluger:** That's where it comes into play.
**Jon Kluger:** So you see a couple categories here.
**Jon Kluger:** We have intent B2C and we have intent B2B.
**Jon Kluger:** Intent B2B, you look at as someone buying something on behalf of a business.
**Jon Kluger:** That could be a software, that could be, you know, janitorial services.
**Jon Kluger:** Anything that a business person would be reaching out for.
**Jon Kluger:** Intent B2C is likely what you'd be delivering your customers.
**Jon Kluger:** That is something that a consumer is looking for.
**Jon Kluger:** So this could be home insurance.
**Jon Kluger:** This could be the Toyota RAV4.
**Jon Kluger:** This could be Gucci.
**Jon Kluger:** The intent categories, there are very Easy is we can actually do a quick example, as a matter of fact.
**Jon Kluger:** What, what is a potential customer of yours and what sort of clientele are they looking for?

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah, my past customers have been insurance companies and financial, more financial services than anything.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Annuities, health insurance, that type of thing.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** So we'll look for health insurance.
**Jon Kluger:** We're going to set the intent window to two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** That is the biggest that we set it to.
**Jon Kluger:** The reason for that is we have found statistically that someone makes that purchase within the first two weeks.
**Jon Kluger:** It's not a long dragged out process.
**Jon Kluger:** If someone is showing high levels of intent over the period of two weeks, they'll likely make a purchase in that time.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so we're looking for health insurance.
**Jon Kluger:** Is there a specific location, a state that you, that we want to focus in?
**Jon Kluger:** We can do I see Florida on your hat.
**Jon Kluger:** Should we do Florida?

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah, let's do Florida.

**Jon Kluger:** And do we want to do a specific age?

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah, probably.

**Jon Kluger:** We have 65 and older.
**Jon Kluger:** 55 to 64.
**Jon Kluger:** 45 to 54.
**Jon Kluger:** 35 to 44.
**Jon Kluger:** 25 to 34.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.
**G Darrell Rigley:** You want to do, you want to do probably 45 to 55.

**Jon Kluger:** Right.
**Jon Kluger:** In that range, do you want 65 and older?

**G Darrell Rigley:** I'm looking for somebody that is wanting to buy an annuity.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay, so we will do those topics, of course, a lot of that, you.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Know, that stuff you'll get from the client, you know, as you build their ideal customer.

**Jon Kluger:** Correct.
**Jon Kluger:** So as what we've just done, Darrell, is we said we want to look for people in Florida between the ages of 45 that are looking for health insurance.
**Jon Kluger:** In the last two weeks, we select build and it says this will take 15 to 20 minutes.
**Jon Kluger:** That's not the case.
**Jon Kluger:** Go ahead and check your phone, see if you got any text messages.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I'm getting them.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Go ahead and check your emails.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Right.

**Jon Kluger:** And just hit refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** What you're going to see here is you're going to see a list of 110,000 people.
**Jon Kluger:** These 110,000 people are confirmed to live in Florida, at least 45 years old.
**Jon Kluger:** And they're showing intense signals for health insurance.
**Jon Kluger:** You can see the different intent signs.
**Jon Kluger:** Some say Love Low is still good.

**G Darrell Rigley:** How many intense.
**G Darrell Rigley:** How many intent, how many intent processes do you go after?

**Jon Kluger:** We have, currently we have on the B2B side 35,000.
**Jon Kluger:** On the B2C, we have 7,000.
**Jon Kluger:** When we update to V2, you won't have to choose from our terms.
**Jon Kluger:** You can put any term you want in.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** All right.
**G Darrell Rigley:** So I mean, when, when you, when somebody, when you classify somebody as doing a behavior, is it one behavior, two behaviors, three behavior.

**Jon Kluger:** It's a consistent appearance of behavior.
**Jon Kluger:** I always use the reference.
**Jon Kluger:** I have a nephew.
**Jon Kluger:** I hand my nephew my phone to entertain him, let's say, and he watches a video from Cocomelon, a kid's show, Right.
**Jon Kluger:** He just watched that video for 30 minutes.
**Jon Kluger:** Do I have intent for Cocomelon?
**Jon Kluger:** No.
**Jon Kluger:** If I did that behavior pattern every single day or numerous times in a day, or I went to numerous different sites to look at Coco Melon, then I'm actually showing intent.
**Jon Kluger:** If you think about this on a grading scale, right?
**Jon Kluger:** Flow is like 85, medium is like 90, high is 95.
**Jon Kluger:** Plus.
**Jon Kluger:** If they're showing up, they're a target.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** That's why we do search.

**G Darrell Rigley:** There's multiple behaviors, okay.

**Jon Kluger:** From over 200 databases to be able to power our platform.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** It's pretty extensive.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Let's say you like this list.
**Jon Kluger:** What do you do with it?
**Jon Kluger:** You hit download all, we name it.
**Jon Kluger:** What you see right now is it says it's processing.
**Jon Kluger:** It's quite, quite a sizable list.
**Jon Kluger:** So it takes a second.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** You can download when it's ready, but you can also do a few other things.
**Jon Kluger:** You can hit schedule.
**Jon Kluger:** So let's say you're building these for your clients and you find a list that's just perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** You select schedule here.
**Jon Kluger:** And what you can do is you can have this list refreshed however often you want.
**Jon Kluger:** If it's every day, if it's every week, if it's every month, it's totally up to you.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** When this is set as scheduled, it will do the refresh.
**Jon Kluger:** All you have to do is come in, redownload it.
**Jon Kluger:** Or alternatively, if you're running ads for a client, you can actually select the ad account that you want the updated list to automatically push to and update.
**Jon Kluger:** Because when it comes to targeting on socials, you're looking for that intent sign for those ads.
**Jon Kluger:** If that two week period has passed, you need to bring in a new list or you need to refresh that constantly.
**Jon Kluger:** Right.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** So this can all be put into.

**Jon Kluger:** Their GHL with the integration that we're establishing in V2.
**Jon Kluger:** Yes.
**Jon Kluger:** So by the time the time V2 goes live, which will be February 15th.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** For each Go High level instance you want to plug into, it'll be $50 a month on top of the $500.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** All right.
**Jon Kluger:** That's it.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** So that's really the platform at a very High level.
**Jon Kluger:** As I mentioned, we allow for you to have that unlimited data pool capabilities, the unlimited website visitors.
**Jon Kluger:** Everything, Everything is designed.
**Jon Kluger:** Sorry, someone was calling me and I didn't recognize the number.
**Jon Kluger:** Everything is designed to properly be set up to essentially make life easiest for you and your customers while being reasonable at price.
**Jon Kluger:** If you went with Go, if you went with Audience Lab, I'm going to be very candid with you, Darryl, because we switch over two of their customers every single day.
**Jon Kluger:** If you go to Audience Lab, what they're going to do is they're going to give you an account that makes it very limited.
**Jon Kluger:** You can only access four audiences total.
**Jon Kluger:** If you mess up one filter, that counts as an audience for the whole month.
**Jon Kluger:** If you accidentally make a mistake, they will charge you hundreds of dollars.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay, we don't believe in that.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah, tell me.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Oh, tell me about the white glove.
**G Darrell Rigley:** You said something about a white glove.
**G Darrell Rigley:** If I wanted white glove, it's like 250amonth.

**Jon Kluger:** It's 250amonth, and it just allows for someone to hop on a call one to one with you.
**Jon Kluger:** They'll hop on a video call with you and give you the support that they need.
**Jon Kluger:** I typically say don't automatically hop into it.
**Jon Kluger:** If you need it, let us know.
**Jon Kluger:** Because what we do currently is if you have issues or you have help, we have videos to give you an initial guide.
**Jon Kluger:** And then if you run into any challenges, you just reach out to us on Slack and we'll be there to support you.
**Jon Kluger:** If you get to a point where you go, jonathan, I want someone to hop on a call with me and walk me through everything that's we can add.

**G Darrell Rigley:** All right, the.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Here's a.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Do you have videos of the demos that you do?
**G Darrell Rigley:** I have a demo for a client.

**Jon Kluger:** Yes.

**G Darrell Rigley:** So, hey, this is how it works.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Do you have those available to me?

**Jon Kluger:** So those will be live February 15th, because we wanted to make sure they reflected V2 and they looked esthetically the best.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** All right.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Now, Daryl, I'll be honest.
**Jon Kluger:** Our price, the offer lasts until February 6th.
**Jon Kluger:** So next Friday after that, we're going to start updating our pricing to reflect V2.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** All right.

**Jon Kluger:** By that, I mean we're doubling the price in detail.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** So you'll get locked in, in perpetuity at the $500 point and you'll never have to worry about anything increasing.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah, hang on one second, let me look at my calendar.

**Jon Kluger:** My.
**Jon Kluger:** My founders wanted to make it this Friday, and I said, come on, guys, you've got to make it next Friday.
**Jon Kluger:** Like, let's be reasonable.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Oh, I don't get paid until the 8th of money.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I've got that.
**G Darrell Rigley:** How?
**G Darrell Rigley:** I'm funding myself.

**Jon Kluger:** For you, Daryl.
**Jon Kluger:** For you, Daryl.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll hold it open until the 8th.
**Jon Kluger:** Just don't tell.
**Jon Kluger:** Don't tell anyone.
**Jon Kluger:** It's our secret.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I don't talk to anybody.

**Jon Kluger:** Perfect.
**Jon Kluger:** I don't either.
**Jon Kluger:** So just you.
**Jon Kluger:** You're the only person.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay, so.
**G Darrell Rigley:** All right, Kent, let me ask you this the first time.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Can I pay a month at a time while I'm building for three months and then switch to quarterly?

**Jon Kluger:** I have to ask transparently.

**G Darrell Rigley:** That would be really helpful because I'm.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I'm bootstrapping everything on this.

**Jon Kluger:** What we can do, alternatively, is if you wanted to lock in at the quarterly price, we have Clara available.
**Jon Kluger:** If you're not familiar with Clarna, it's one of those payment processors that you pay.
**Jon Kluger:** They pay the upfront cost, and then you pay it in a monthly installment.
**Jon Kluger:** So you'd still get the $500 monthly price, their fees, about 30 bucks per month.
**Jon Kluger:** So technically, it would be 530 for the first quarter a month because they're paying us the fifteen hundred dollars up front.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Through the portal, through the payment link.
**Jon Kluger:** You just select Clarinet to pay, and it will literally take care of everything.
**Jon Kluger:** First month, you'll pay the 500.
**Jon Kluger:** Second month, you'll pay 530.
**Jon Kluger:** Third month, you'll pay 530.
**Jon Kluger:** Then you can choose just to pay with 1500 again.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**G Darrell Rigley:** All right.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I probably don't want to go that route.

**Jon Kluger:** Internally.
**Jon Kluger:** My question is, is if you're using a credit card, let's say, can you.
**Jon Kluger:** Can.
**Jon Kluger:** If I get it down to 500amonth, can you pay by the 6th?

**G Darrell Rigley:** Say what now?

**Jon Kluger:** If I'm able to get it to a monthly payment for the $500.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Can you pay on the 6th?
**Jon Kluger:** Because my only fear is if I say I want to extend Darryl this rate to the ninth, but then I also have to ask for it to be switched to monthly.
**Jon Kluger:** They might say one or the other.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay, so my.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Your question is on the 6th?
**G Darrell Rigley:** On the.
**G Darrell Rigley:** On the.

**Jon Kluger:** The.
**Jon Kluger:** If I get it for $500 on a month to month payment for you, can you pay the first month on the 6th?

**G Darrell Rigley:** You know, I should be able to.

**Jon Kluger:** Then I can get that.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I'll pull it together somehow, and I can.

**Jon Kluger:** I can negotiate to get you the month to month at 500.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** All right.

**Jon Kluger:** I can.
**Jon Kluger:** I can fight for you.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** All right.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Because I'm not gonna.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I'm not gonna need the service until middle of February.
**G Darrell Rigley:** End of February.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** So let me.
**Jon Kluger:** Let me get that straightened out for you and we can make that work.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** How long have you been doing this?

**Jon Kluger:** Me personally or the business?

**G Darrell Rigley:** The business.

**Jon Kluger:** Business started back in September.
**Jon Kluger:** Officially, our technical co founder has been building this data pipeline in this platform for 15 years.
**Jon Kluger:** He just had it as a tool that he used one to one with companies in the Fortune 100.
**Jon Kluger:** And then he turned around and was like, you know what?
**Jon Kluger:** I don't want to have to do all this work.
**Jon Kluger:** I have kids.
**Jon Kluger:** I want to hang out with the kids.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm gonna find a bunch of sales guys and guys who are passionate about this to do all the work while I just built the platform and I said, sign me up.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.

**Jon Kluger:** Okay.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I. I've built so many salesforces, I don't want to do that again.
**G Darrell Rigley:** That's why I'm going with AI.
**G Darrell Rigley:** It's just so cool.

**Jon Kluger:** 100.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm hoping this is.
**Jon Kluger:** I'm hoping this will be the last one I have to do.
**Jon Kluger:** And this company will be very, very successful.
**Jon Kluger:** And with the goals we have, I think we will achieve that.
**Jon Kluger:** And then after that, you know, maybe I'll be moving down to Florida and get myself a boat.

**G Darrell Rigley:** There you go.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I'll be with you, man.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Anything you can send me.

**Jon Kluger:** Great.

**G Darrell Rigley:** That I can look at.
**G Darrell Rigley:** In the meantime.

**Jon Kluger:** Fireflies is going to send you an email.
**Jon Kluger:** That email will have the recording of this and the transcript and summary.
**Jon Kluger:** Okay.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I've used them before.
**G Darrell Rigley:** They're good.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I hate taking notes in a meeting.

**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** Give you the ability to focus.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I can't read my notes.

**Jon Kluger:** I'm the same way.
**Jon Kluger:** This is what my handwriting looks like.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.
**G Darrell Rigley:** That's good, man.

**Jon Kluger:** I always joke I have the handwriting of a doctor without the education.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.

**Jon Kluger:** Excellent.
**Jon Kluger:** All right.

**G Darrell Rigley:** I gotta make some money, so.

**Jon Kluger:** Absolutely.
**Jon Kluger:** We'll be in touch.
**Jon Kluger:** All right.
**Jon Kluger:** Keep an eye out for an email from me, Daryl.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Okay.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I appreciate your time, man.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Thank you.
**G Darrell Rigley:** All right.
**G Darrell Rigley:** See you later.

**Jon Kluger:** See you.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Now stay warm.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Where are you at?

**Jon Kluger:** I'm in North Carolina.
**Jon Kluger:** We got where the snow is melting, but it's still icy as hell.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah.
**G Darrell Rigley:** You don't know Brett Moeller?
**G Darrell Rigley:** Brett Mueller.
**G Darrell Rigley:** You don't know him.
**G Darrell Rigley:** He and Tommy Leontano are in North Carolina.
**G Darrell Rigley:** They ran a thing called List.

**Jon Kluger:** AI Growth guy.
**Jon Kluger:** Yeah, yeah.
**Jon Kluger:** I've seen his stuff.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Lift Certain.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Yeah, I was.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I paid.
**G Darrell Rigley:** I paid them like 500 bucks for a long time, man.
**G Darrell Rigley:** They could never really put it together the data.
**G Darrell Rigley:** They would change their.
**G Darrell Rigley:** They would change their marketing out policy or whatever.
**G Darrell Rigley:** It seemed like monthly.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Try this, try that, try this.
**G Darrell Rigley:** It was exhausting.

**Jon Kluger:** Oh, I bet.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Nice guys and they.
**G Darrell Rigley:** They knew their stuff.
**G Darrell Rigley:** But they a little impatient.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Tommy, would you.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Tommy would have you bring a customer to him and he treated like.

**Jon Kluger:** That's not how we operate.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll tell you that, brother.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Well, understanding these people are asking questions, right?

**Jon Kluger:** Anyway.
**Jon Kluger:** Anyway, we will be in touch.
**Jon Kluger:** Keep an eye out.
**Jon Kluger:** I'll follow as well.
**Jon Kluger:** And I look forward to working together.

**G Darrell Rigley:** Thanks, man.
**G Darrell Rigley:** Have a good day.

**Jon Kluger:** You too.
**Jon Kluger:** Bye now.
