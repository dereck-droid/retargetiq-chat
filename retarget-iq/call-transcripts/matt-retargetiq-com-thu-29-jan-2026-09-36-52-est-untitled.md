## Transcript

**Matthew Bryce:** Accurate.
**Matthew Bryce:** But apparently when they started this company, unless I'm thinking of a different company, apparently, they were literally like listening.
**Matthew Bryce:** They would say.
**Matthew Bryce:** It would say like, you know, friends from Fireflies.
**Matthew Bryce:** And it was actually like people that would just sit there and transcribe the whole meeting by hand until they had the ability to actually create the whole about it.
**Matthew Bryce:** Which is pretty crazy.

**Trevor Cox:** That is crazy.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** Imagine building a plane while it's flying and you're just listening to hundreds of meetings and just taking notes and then transcribing it so then you can give it to the people.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, that sounds a little tedious.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, for sure.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we got that and figured that out.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** Just in case you were wondering, I went to the meetings tab and then it just said kind of like invite.
**Matthew Bryce:** And you just take your link, copy it and put it into the.
**Matthew Bryce:** Into the pop up that comes up.

**Trevor Cox:** Okay.

**Matthew Bryce:** Waited a few seconds and Fred said, I want to join.
**Matthew Bryce:** Awesome.

**Trevor Cox:** Very cool.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, do you want to kick it off?

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, yeah, for sure.
**Trevor Cox:** We can go ahead and do that.
**Trevor Cox:** Here, let me just get this.
**Trevor Cox:** Awesome.
**Trevor Cox:** Alrighty, so let me make sure.
**Trevor Cox:** Can you see what I'm seeing?

**Matthew Bryce:** Yes, I can see where you're seeing a little hazy.

**Trevor Cox:** Little hazy.
**Trevor Cox:** Okay.

**Matthew Bryce:** I wonder if that's because I can see the video if I. Oh, there we go.

**Trevor Cox:** Awesome.
**Trevor Cox:** Alrighty.
**Trevor Cox:** Alrighty.
**Trevor Cox:** So, yeah, basically, to start it off, yeah, I would obviously do some rapport building, so just asking some simple questions, getting a little bit of background on the business that I am trying to aid in some way.
**Trevor Cox:** So, yeah, just looking to see what their intent for using our software is.
**Trevor Cox:** Then once I gathered that information, I would kind of come to this homepage here, go through the whole kind of skid of we're able to uniquely identify 40 to 70% of our visitors just from visiting a pixel.
**Trevor Cox:** So you get five pixels per license.
**Trevor Cox:** If you have the white label package, it's going to be 50 pixels that come with it.
**Trevor Cox:** Down here, if we scroll down, you can actually see a map geolocating all of the visitors to the site.
**Trevor Cox:** This is like a very useful feature because if you were to say, scroll into your home city of Raleigh and you can see.
**Trevor Cox:** Okay, yeah, we're getting some good hits around here.
**Trevor Cox:** There might be some more hits in Cary than there are over towards Clayton.
**Trevor Cox:** So if I have a store out in Clayton, might be better for me to actually kind of look at this data and see where the hits are so I can drive business.
**Trevor Cox:** Might be a better idea to open up a Location in Cary.
**Trevor Cox:** And that way you can kind of see where people are actually coming from.
**Trevor Cox:** Let's go up here.
**Trevor Cox:** So if we go through here, we have all this data from visitor identification.
**Trevor Cox:** Go through and you can actually see that we have their phone number, we have their age, their marital status, our address information, we have their device me IDs, we have their categories of behavior and we even have their properties.
**Trevor Cox:** And sometimes what we'll populate down here is their vehicle.
**Trevor Cox:** So even if you were looking to directly market people with specific vehicles, we can go ahead and do that for you.
**Trevor Cox:** Right over here is our direct mail.
**Trevor Cox:** So you are actually able to set up a trigger on any point.
**Trevor Cox:** So say you have a homepage and somebody clicked on an ad.
**Trevor Cox:** If you had that trigger point when they clicked on that ad and then close out of the window, we can actually immediately send mail directly to their address.
**Trevor Cox:** It starts at about 90 cents, including postage for every send, which is leagues cheaper than every other platform.
**Trevor Cox:** And I would say that we're unique and Audience Labs does not offer this as a capability.
**Trevor Cox:** So we can really kind of step up there.
**Trevor Cox:** If we're going here, this is just going to be like the actual paths that people use to get to the site.
**Trevor Cox:** So you can use this information to see basically where like the leads kind of sent and which ones are going to be the most effective and kind of edit from there.
**Trevor Cox:** And then if we were pretending that this is a business, let's say they are really intent, I would say let's.

**Matthew Bryce:** Go with something that I've seen a lot of people talk about is either solar panels.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yep.
**Matthew Bryce:** Or loans kind of from the fireflies that I've been watching.
**Matthew Bryce:** So I got you.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, we can go ahead and just do solar panels then.
**Trevor Cox:** So what we're going to do is we're going to do B2C because we're going to assume that we are a solar panel company that is trying to contact customers and kind of drive interest in that.
**Trevor Cox:** So what I'm going to do here is I'm actually going to set this date back two weeks.
**Trevor Cox:** That period of intent is usually because that is the buyer window.
**Trevor Cox:** After that two week period is up, people have generally already made a decision for the majority of cases.
**Trevor Cox:** This is especially true if you're working in like the automotive industry and you're looking to, you know, repair vehicles or if there's somebody looking to replace windows.
**Trevor Cox:** Nobody's going to really research that for more than two weeks.
**Trevor Cox:** So that's usually why we cap it off there.
**Trevor Cox:** And Then we go here, we can go to solar panels.
**Trevor Cox:** And then I'm going to add a rule.
**Trevor Cox:** So we are going to go down here, we're going to just select state.
**Trevor Cox:** We'll go ahead and do in and we'll choose New Jersey.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, awesome.
**Trevor Cox:** And then I am going to add another rule here.
**Trevor Cox:** And then this is just going to be the LinkedIn URL.
**Trevor Cox:** We're just going to select the status as has value.
**Trevor Cox:** What we found is that more data is generated from Those with a LinkedIn URL so we get more financial information.
**Trevor Cox:** So I'm just going to go ahead and click Build audience here.
**Trevor Cox:** All right, so once you get to this page, we do say that it takes about 15 to 20 minutes, but that's just so that people don't freak out and like, if they don't get their data immediately, they're not sitting there just jamming the refresh button.
**Trevor Cox:** During this time period, we just recommend that you check your email, kind of look through your phone, fiddle around a little bit, maybe check in your dog.
**Trevor Cox:** But once you do that, come on back, just click the refresh button.
**Trevor Cox:** And as you can see here, we were able to pull 6,400, almost 6,500 individuals that have been looking for solar panels in New Jersey just in the past two weeks.
**Trevor Cox:** So we do score their intent category.
**Trevor Cox:** Let me see here.
**Trevor Cox:** We do score their levels of intent, but that's not really something that you have to focus on because even our lowest level of intent is much higher than what would even be categorized within, like audience Labs or other software that you may be using.
**Trevor Cox:** So our lowest level of intent, you still have to have at least three points of contact to do that.
**Trevor Cox:** So they have clicked on an ad, visited a site, and then have already, like, kind of gone through looking themselves either for an SEO.
**Trevor Cox:** Oh, let's see there.
**Trevor Cox:** Cool.
**Trevor Cox:** So yeah, and if you wanted to target individuals that have like a actual hire, we can just go through.
**Trevor Cox:** We can click medium.
**Trevor Cox:** We can try and find anybody with.
**Trevor Cox:** I don't see anybody with super high intents on this page.
**Trevor Cox:** Let's see.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, but we can sort by that.
**Trevor Cox:** So here we have a great example of a high.
**Trevor Cox:** So, yeah, Yoshiokura.
**Trevor Cox:** So this person is definitely going to need their solar panels checked.
**Trevor Cox:** So we can go ahead and get all the information from here.
**Trevor Cox:** And if you want to.
**Trevor Cox:** What we can do.
**Trevor Cox:** Let's go.
**Trevor Cox:** Awesome.
**Trevor Cox:** Cool, cool.
**Trevor Cox:** So we can actually download that as a CSV file.
**Trevor Cox:** But what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to save it as a generic.
**Trevor Cox:** So we're going to do solar panels, New Jersey do the same thing for the description.
**Trevor Cox:** And I just like to keep it simple and to the point when I'm saving these.
**Trevor Cox:** So when I go back and I look at them again, I'm not really having an issue finding them.
**Trevor Cox:** So if I wanted to, what I can do here is I can actually schedule this, export it as CSV or I can schedule it to an ad account.
**Trevor Cox:** So what I could do is right now we have webhooks, but we are going to be fixing this in V2, which will come out on February 15th.
**Trevor Cox:** So every single time that you want to do this, all you have to do is click in your webhook URL and then you can select repeat.
**Trevor Cox:** You can do this like say every Sunday if you're seeing that traffic is really driven earlier in the week around Monday, Tuesday or I would like to get the campaign kicked off a little bit before.
**Trevor Cox:** So like say every Sunday night you can refresh the list that will use new user generated data that is within that two week time period and it refreshes itself and clears out the old and with the new so you can just kind of step away and let like a drip campaign take care of itself.
**Trevor Cox:** Down here for integrations we offer quite a bit.
**Trevor Cox:** So you know, you can use ours.
**Trevor Cox:** But if you want to go to like your own CRM, we have HubSpot, go high level.
**Trevor Cox:** We have Google Ads Connector, Salesforce.
**Trevor Cox:** And one of the things that we kind of pride ourselves on is we have like a 90% intent match rate with SHA256.
**Trevor Cox:** So that's going to be Facebook's, you know, ad data.
**Trevor Cox:** So if you have any questions I can go ahead and answer those.
**Trevor Cox:** But otherwise as far as pricing goes, it's really cheap comparatively to like any of our other competitors.
**Trevor Cox:** So right here I pulled up the price tag.
**Trevor Cox:** I can go or not the price tag, but the Excel sheet kind of showing the price breakdown.
**Trevor Cox:** I can go ahead and screenshot this and send it to you.
**Trevor Cox:** But basically for a single license it's going to be about $500 a month quarterly.
**Trevor Cox:** And that does not include the API.
**Trevor Cox:** But I really don't suggest that to most people unless you really need the kind of like, I don't know, the walkthrough and everything.
**Trevor Cox:** If you're familiar with the space, it's not really necessary.
**Trevor Cox:** And then if you did want it annually, it's going to be $417.
**Trevor Cox:** So it's going to be like A pretty steep discount there.
**Trevor Cox:** What I can say is that the prices are going up in V2.
**Trevor Cox:** So on February 15, we're increasing the price to about $1,000 for the monthly category there.
**Trevor Cox:** So that's going to bring the quarterly up to about $700.
**Trevor Cox:** The good part is if you hop on now, I can go ahead and grandfather you into the first pricing.
**Trevor Cox:** So if, you know, we're locked in, and six months from now it continues going up in price, I'm never going to change that for you.
**Trevor Cox:** And we will keep that at that.
**Trevor Cox:** Now, if you wanted the white label option, this is usually for, you know, marketing industries that are trying to sell their licenses more than likely.
**Trevor Cox:** So they come with 10 licenses, which is 50 pixels, 5 pixels each license, and that usually it does start at $4,000 a month, and you get about $1,000 discount if you sign up for the annual.
**Trevor Cox:** And after the 10 pixels, each additional pixel is only $100 each.
**Trevor Cox:** So if you wanted to, you can actually use this as a way to actually, like, cover your expenses.
**Trevor Cox:** If you have clients that are looking for licenses and they have their own CRMs, what we can do is actually brand it directly to you and then you can sell that to your clients, say, for $500 to $1,000 a license within three or four licenses sold, you'll be covering the complete cost of your own license.
**Trevor Cox:** So we always like to point that out for people if they're looking to kind of possibly make money off this.
**Trevor Cox:** Because at the end of the day, we're kind of just looking to create these business relationships with one another.
**Trevor Cox:** We're not here to nickel and dime.
**Trevor Cox:** We are just here to, you know, provide, like, a great service and a great product, and we truly stand by it.
**Trevor Cox:** So if you have any questions, I'm going to go ahead and send out the payment link to you, but go ahead and give me a shout back.
**Trevor Cox:** I will get back to you within 24 hours, guaranteed.
**Trevor Cox:** And if you have any further questions, I can go ahead and get you in contact with our onboarding agent, Cindy, and she will walk you through the rest of the.
**Trevor Cox:** Awesome.

**Matthew Bryce:** Very nice.
**Matthew Bryce:** Which now made me actually think.
**Matthew Bryce:** Do you have the payment link?

**Trevor Cox:** I do not.

**Matthew Bryce:** Now you're asking just in case of anything.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, I think that was great.
**Matthew Bryce:** You covered, as far as I remember, from everything that I've watched, you know, you covered all the bases.
**Matthew Bryce:** So, yeah, I guess I'll give it a swing myself.

**Trevor Cox:** Okay, cool, cool.

**Matthew Bryce:** When?
**Matthew Bryce:** Actually, quick question for you, and it's just something that I noticed in some of the flies mentioning Zeta Global as the data partner.
**Matthew Bryce:** But recently and I spoke to Alex, he was like, you know, unless you're really pushed, kind of don't mention that.

**Trevor Cox:** Yes.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, that's, that's been my understanding because yeah, I was super excited to be like, yeah, we got data.
**Trevor Cox:** But then like they were like, no, now you can't say that.
**Trevor Cox:** So, you know, I think I'm gonna just do it kind of.
**Trevor Cox:** I'm not going to mention it like they said, unless it's like super pushed by like the high up dude that I'm really trying to secure or something like.
**Trevor Cox:** Oh, it's, I don't, I can't say the company like, you know.

**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, with Ada, something like that.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** And they're global.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, cool.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, so.
**Matthew Bryce:** There we go.
**Matthew Bryce:** Awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** How's the view there?

**Trevor Cox:** Looking great.

**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, great.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah.
**Matthew Bryce:** So Matt, want to take you through retargetiq.
**Matthew Bryce:** Believe you came through by seeing our ad probably through Facebook about how we're better than Audience Lab.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I think that to kind of give you a high level view of everything is we say that we're better than Audience Lab because of the data that we're capable of providing.
**Matthew Bryce:** And that's a much better data set, a much better data set than they're able to cover.
**Matthew Bryce:** And then we also run it through a waterfall of 200 other data sets.
**Matthew Bryce:** So you're getting a very robust piece of, you're getting a very robust platform that comes with some of the best data that you're going to find in the country.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now this screen here is showing one of our current clients, United Capital Source, which is a loan company.
**Matthew Bryce:** And as you can see, they've, in the past week They've had almost 9,000 users of which 50% our data was able to identify for them.
**Matthew Bryce:** And when you ask what it is that that's being identified, it's everything from name to email, where they came from, their address, and it's taking all the information that we're able to get from that 200 plus data partners.
**Matthew Bryce:** From the 200 plus data partners.
**Matthew Bryce:** And now you're able to activate on that.
**Matthew Bryce:** So why did they come to their website?
**Matthew Bryce:** Did they convert?
**Matthew Bryce:** Did they not convert?
**Matthew Bryce:** How can you get them to convert if they didn't convert?
**Matthew Bryce:** And let's say you wanted to hit them with direct mail because we have their address and you want to remind them maybe in a week or two we have that capability.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's something that Audience Lab doesn't have.
**Matthew Bryce:** We can easily take, create A campaign or create triggers for.
**Matthew Bryce:** Why is that not popular?
**Matthew Bryce:** There we go.
**Matthew Bryce:** Sorry, I clicked the wrong one.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right.
**Matthew Bryce:** Designs usually drop in your postcards or a letter and we usually charge 90 cents for that campaign.
**Matthew Bryce:** And it is.
**Matthew Bryce:** Sorry, I got tripped up here just now.
**Matthew Bryce:** Wait a second.
**Matthew Bryce:** Where was.
**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, it's the create, isn't it?
**Matthew Bryce:** There it is.
**Matthew Bryce:** Okay.
**Matthew Bryce:** Sorry about that.
**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, kid, let me rewind it a little bit.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, so from.
**Matthew Bryce:** After you.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we're going to go run through the visitor identification.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're able to see exactly where those visitors are from.
**Matthew Bryce:** We get their name, their email and even their address and where they are.
**Matthew Bryce:** Did they convert?
**Matthew Bryce:** Did they not convert?
**Matthew Bryce:** Now if they didn't convert and you want to remind them in a week or two, we have the ability that something that audience life doesn't have is the capability of sending them direct mail.
**Matthew Bryce:** We can easily create a campaign.
**Matthew Bryce:** You hit the create trigger, you're able to name your campaign.
**Matthew Bryce:** You can put in your URL path.
**Matthew Bryce:** Is it a postcard, is it a letter?
**Matthew Bryce:** And you could also to set up a frequency.
**Matthew Bryce:** So maybe you want to hit them once or twice over the course of the next three months and do some type of drip campaign to get them to reminder to remind them what it is that they were looking for.
**Matthew Bryce:** Over that intent window, you're also able to see what websites they've come from and where, what websites drove them to our web, to the web page.
**Matthew Bryce:** Expand that a little bit.
**Matthew Bryce:** There we go.
**Matthew Bryce:** So there's seven views from Google for instance, for this one place.
**Matthew Bryce:** Also two, you have your organic views.
**Matthew Bryce:** Business loans.
**Matthew Bryce:** So somebody was googling business loans.
**Matthew Bryce:** They went from DuckDuckGo, Google.
**Matthew Bryce:** So a couple of different various spots that we're able to see and track from now.
**Matthew Bryce:** One of the key pieces that I love about this platform and why I've actually joined the team is because of their ability to actually now dive into audiences.
**Matthew Bryce:** And not only just creating an audience and seeing a search from, let's just say some type of doing an advanced search on any type of demographic or any type of details, we could actually get intent data.
**Matthew Bryce:** And then intent data is really powerful because, you know, you're getting people that are actively looking for what it is that you're providing.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we can do that from a B2C perspective or we could do it from B2B.
**Matthew Bryce:** And the best part of it all is, is we isolate to just a two week window.
**Matthew Bryce:** And now if you ask why two weeks is because it all comes down to the buying cycle.
**Matthew Bryce:** Somebody's starting to search and somebody's googling or looking on Facebook or wherever it is that their touch points are online that we're able to track.
**Matthew Bryce:** It's going to be a two week window.
**Matthew Bryce:** After two weeks, more than likely they're going to have already made a decision and made their purchase.
**Matthew Bryce:** You want to get them early in that intent window and make sure that you're going to be reaching them many times in order to convert them.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we're going to kick it back from the 15th to get that full two week window as I mentioned.
**Matthew Bryce:** And if you want, you could also do a day.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you really want to get somebody with really high intent, you could do the past couple of days when you know that they've started to actively search.
**Matthew Bryce:** Let's say you're looking for solar panels in the B2C usually just start to type in solar.
**Matthew Bryce:** It's going to come up with a bunch of information that you're able to isolate into.
**Matthew Bryce:** And the best part is in V2 it's going to be a lot more robust.
**Matthew Bryce:** We have that rolling out on February 15th and it is going to be really powerful in helping you build whether it's an advanced search or from an intent profile.
**Matthew Bryce:** I like to also add in the LinkedIn URL because now you're going to be getting information on somebody to make sure that, sorry, LinkedIn URL you want to click has value.
**Matthew Bryce:** We like to add that in because you're going to be getting deeper information on people and you're going to know exactly what type of industry they're in.
**Matthew Bryce:** And it also too helps to isolate maybe like their household income usually.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're going to also add an email just to make sure we get that.
**Matthew Bryce:** And we're only going to isolate it to people that has a value.
**Matthew Bryce:** So in case that they didn't have, in case their email wasn't in any of the data set, then they're not going to be included in this.
**Matthew Bryce:** And let's say we want to get somebody with.
**Matthew Bryce:** As you can see there, there's a ton of different type of options you can choose as rules to make sure that you're able to isolate down anything exactly what people are looking for.
**Matthew Bryce:** Let's go with state and they're going to be in state.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're going to check.
**Matthew Bryce:** Why isn't that working?
**Matthew Bryce:** North Carolina, don't know why that wasn't working when I started to type it.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we're just.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah.

**Matthew Bryce:** So now the best part of this is, is that we do say depending on the processing time I take up to 15 to 20 minutes.
**Matthew Bryce:** And that's just to kind of set the st of hey, you know, normally we could, we could do it instantly, but in case there's an issue and we can't do it instantly, just give us some time.
**Matthew Bryce:** But generally speaking, if you check your email, you check your phone really quickly, within I'd say max a minute or two, you're going to get that data.
**Matthew Bryce:** But it should happen relatively quick.
**Matthew Bryce:** Relatively quick compared to that.
**Matthew Bryce:** And as you can see, in North Carolina, there are about 7,000 people that have been looking for solar panels in the past two weeks.
**Matthew Bryce:** And we're able to get their first name, last name.
**Matthew Bryce:** We know each and every single one of these people has their email.
**Matthew Bryce:** They also have LinkedIn which is going to give us a little bit more robust data behind it.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now you can actually look into it and see, hey, you know what, what exactly does this person do?

**Trevor Cox:** Right?

**Matthew Bryce:** If you're looking for more of a higher value target because you're selling very expensive solar panels, you're going to know that hey, you know, what type of business are they in?
**Matthew Bryce:** And this is something here.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now you get your company name because it's also tied back to the LinkedIn and it talks about exactly what their, what their companies are built around.
**Matthew Bryce:** So is it a giant corporation or is it somebody that's, you know, powering system engineering, like an engineering, you know, what type of company and then also to what their income range is and what their net worth is.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's what I love about this platform is you're able to leverage all the intent data.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now we know Audience Lab also has that as well, but as I mentioned, this is much more robust data.
**Matthew Bryce:** One thing that I completely forgot to take you through was the visitor identification side.
**Matthew Bryce:** See more and here it's going to, you get a quick overview of exactly who those visitors are and what devices they're using, their IP addresses, their financial information.
**Matthew Bryce:** And we're also going to be in V2.
**Matthew Bryce:** We're going to be getting much more robust data that's going to roll into that credit score and really making sure that we know that they're of high value targets.
**Matthew Bryce:** I also want to show you exactly what the data is going to look like when it comes out.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm glad that we're doing this because.
**Matthew Bryce:** Why is that not flipping over?
**Matthew Bryce:** Sorry Trevor, give me a second.

**Trevor Cox:** No worries at all.
**Trevor Cox:** No.
**Trevor Cox:** Mine was doing the same thing earlier.
**Trevor Cox:** I was having issues.
**Trevor Cox:** My integration stab wasn't even working, so I had to troubleshoot that with Alex and everything.
**Trevor Cox:** Get it?
**Trevor Cox:** Yes.

**Matthew Bryce:** Wait a second.
**Matthew Bryce:** What the hell is going on here?
**Matthew Bryce:** Oh, okay.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, There we go.
**Matthew Bryce:** I gotta ask John is in.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, I gotta ask John how to get it to see everything and not just a View tab.
**Matthew Bryce:** And that's my problem, is I was just viewing a tab and not viewing everything.
**Matthew Bryce:** All right, yeah, back into it.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, I got it.

**Matthew Bryce:** Now I want to show you exactly what the sample report looks like.
**Matthew Bryce:** After you download the report, you pull the report.
**Matthew Bryce:** It's going to give you all that information that we saw, which is quite.
**Matthew Bryce:** Which is quite amazing.
**Matthew Bryce:** You could take this, you can, and you can leverage it into a CSV file and you can help, and you can upload that into any type of CRM that you have.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm going to go through your.
**Matthew Bryce:** Through the integrations that we have shortly, but I wanted to give you a quick overview of what the data looks like when you pull it out.
**Matthew Bryce:** And also too, I want to highlight the SHA256 code that's up here that traces back to Meta's identifiers.
**Matthew Bryce:** And that's a huge and powerful tool because now you're able to break through the walled garden of Facebook.
**Matthew Bryce:** Meta has been tracking people for God knows how long.
**Matthew Bryce:** We know that they probably know more about us than we even do.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now when you take all the data that we have and you combine it with SHA256 code that pops into Meta, you're going to be able to.
**Matthew Bryce:** And you're getting the most robust data that you possibly can, and then you're going to leverage that data now when you're going to be advertising against it.
**Matthew Bryce:** So whether you're doing an SEO campaign or you're going to be doing a social campaign, you're leveraging all the data that Meta has, plus the data that we have on top of it, which is going to give you a much more robust and a highly intent person that's going to lead to more conversion rates.
**Matthew Bryce:** Awesome.
**Matthew Bryce:** Okay, got that to work there.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now to go.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now to quickly go back to the platform, the integrations that I mentioned that we have, we have integrations with HubSpot go high level.
**Matthew Bryce:** We could also integrate with Meta, which is amazing, as I just mentioned, now you can leverage that SHA code right into Meta and you're breaking through that walled garden with even better data.
**Matthew Bryce:** And then their new AI Andromeda, is very powerful in the sense that it's going to be able to take the data that you're giving it, see who's Converting and then start to map that and push it even to into look alike models that are very similar to those people that are converting.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now you're taking very powerful data, putting it into a very powerful machine, getting it even more and more an even more powerful engine to push the advertising and that advertising spend that, that you're, that you're going through.
**Matthew Bryce:** We can also connect to Google Ads which is huge.
**Matthew Bryce:** So between Meta and Google you're getting a very powerful advertising campaign or Klaviyo which is for email and Beehive or Slack in case you have people that you're working with.
**Matthew Bryce:** You can easily download a CSV file, send it over to Slack and then Slack can take it and then they were able to download it and upload it onto their system them as well.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now I'm going to ask you if you have any questions for me.
**Matthew Bryce:** I just ran through a lot and I probably a little over may have overwhelmed you.
**Matthew Bryce:** So let's take a step back.
**Matthew Bryce:** Do you have any questions for me?
**Matthew Bryce:** Let's kind of, you know, understand a little bit more of what you like, maybe what you want to understand more of.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, yeah, no, I think everything you explained very well I guess just kind of running through the pricing real quick just to kind of, kind of see what that's looking like.

**Matthew Bryce:** So I had that.
**Matthew Bryce:** I usually like to save that for last because when you see the pricing your draw is going to drop and that's going to make me really happy here.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now when it comes to pricing, one reason we are that we say that we're better than Audience Lab and that's the reason why you clicked on the ad and came here is I'm going to show you is we are priced better than Audience Lab and in the sense of one license gets you five websites that you're able to use our Superpixel on, you're going to get unlimited audience and unlimited runs.
**Matthew Bryce:** That's not something that Audience Lab is giving as far as we know and that and, and we're, and we want to make sure that we're not nickeling and diming everybody and we're going to give you the ability to do whatever it is that you want to do with the data.
**Matthew Bryce:** You can run it as many times as you want, you can download it daily if you really want to.
**Matthew Bryce:** You could have it happen each hour and really refresh every hour.
**Matthew Bryce:** I mean, I don't know who wants to refresh every hour unless you have a really, really compelling story that you know people are buying within, within five minutes.
**Matthew Bryce:** But outside of that, you can run the data as much as you want every single day.
**Matthew Bryce:** And that's the beauty of what we offer, is you can have that report refresh every single day without having to worry about being capped on those, on those runs.
**Matthew Bryce:** So now if you would like API access, that's going to be another.
**Matthew Bryce:** We offer that as well, or even a white glove service.
**Matthew Bryce:** But we tend to say let's start with the basics and work our way up as we need it.
**Matthew Bryce:** Right?
**Matthew Bryce:** We don't want to spend money just to spend money.
**Matthew Bryce:** So we always say start with a single license and single license on a monthly basis.
**Matthew Bryce:** Currently, right now, before we launch, V2 is $750.
**Matthew Bryce:** You buy it on a quarterly basis, it's $500 per month.
**Matthew Bryce:** So basically by two months, get one free.
**Matthew Bryce:** Pretty amazing.
**Matthew Bryce:** And once V2 launches and you, you're gonna have a more robust platform and even better data, you're going to be grandfathered into that crisis and it's going to be in perpetuity.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now, if you want to go from an annual perspective, which I mean, don't get me wrong, I'd love that, but I'd rather you test it out first.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I always say start quarterly because then we could always upgrade to annually.
**Matthew Bryce:** So you get the two months in, you buy two months, get one free.
**Matthew Bryce:** That would end up being 417amonth.
**Matthew Bryce:** Now, if you are selling the data as well, and you know you have clients that are really looking for this type of data and you want to provide it to them, we also have a white label option.
**Matthew Bryce:** It's going to come out to.
**Matthew Bryce:** You get 10 licenses with that, five super pixels per license.
**Matthew Bryce:** And again, everybody gets unlimited of everything.
**Matthew Bryce:** We don't cap you at all.
**Matthew Bryce:** All you got to do is pay your bill and you're able to use our platform and our data with the white label, you do get the API access already included and that comes out to monthly $4,000 a month.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you do it quarterly, come down to360, 365 per license per month.
**Matthew Bryce:** So it's 3650 because you're getting the 10 licenses and annually is $3,000.

**Trevor Cox:** No, everything seemed pretty straightforward.

**Matthew Bryce:** All right, awesome question that I want to ask.
**Matthew Bryce:** Clues is if I'm correct, right, Trevor?
**Matthew Bryce:** Because you mentioned it also, and I've seen it.
**Matthew Bryce:** If you want to add a pixel, it's $10 or is it $50?
**Matthew Bryce:** Or am I confusing that with.

**Trevor Cox:** That's why I'm a little confused.
**Trevor Cox:** By this too, because from my understanding, it's a hundred dollars per pixel and.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, so that's why it's like when it's saying the $50 for each additional.
**Trevor Cox:** That doesn't really make sense to me.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, yeah, I might.

**Matthew Bryce:** It was.
**Matthew Bryce:** And I could have.
**Matthew Bryce:** When I heard $10, that's where I'm confused too.
**Matthew Bryce:** I'm like, wait, is it $10 for the website maybe?
**Matthew Bryce:** Or is it.
**Matthew Bryce:** And that's where $10 for a website, adding it on, but then.

**Trevor Cox:** But like not the license.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, I don't know.
**Trevor Cox:** I don't know.
**Trevor Cox:** I'm slightly confused by that because I have also heard that the ten dollar point.
**Trevor Cox:** And I was like completely thrown off by that.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, yeah, yeah.
**Trevor Cox:** The way that I'm saying it for now, at least just a hundred dollars like per pixel extra over the 10.
**Trevor Cox:** But I know that that's the case.
**Trevor Cox:** But I don't know the 50 or $10 thing going on.

**Matthew Bryce:** Look, we'll get the clarity on that.
**Matthew Bryce:** Just.
**Matthew Bryce:** Yeah, yeah, just so then we make sure that we're giving the right information.
**Matthew Bryce:** Because also too, I don't want to tell somebody one thing.
**Matthew Bryce:** And then they're like, wait a second, never mind.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, 100.

**Matthew Bryce:** And they're like, wait, bro, you told me that you weren't trying to nickel and dime me and now you're trying to nickel and die me.

**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, Yeah, I feel that.
**Trevor Cox:** Yeah, definitely something to get a confirmation on.
**Trevor Cox:** I'll see what he's doing here in a second.
**Trevor Cox:** I think he's on a call, but I will check with him.
**Trevor Cox:** All right.

**Matthew Bryce:** Awesome.

**Trevor Cox:** Heck yeah, man.

**Matthew Bryce:** I'm going to boot Fireflies.

**Trevor Cox:** Sounds good.
