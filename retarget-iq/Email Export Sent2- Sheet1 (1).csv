Hey Danny.


I wanted to personally reach out and take responsibility here — the delay 
on getting your white-label setup fully moving was on us.

That’s not the experience we want you to have, especially after signing up, 
so to make this right we’re going to push your billing date back and make 
sure you’re only billed once everything is fully live and delivered as 
promised.

Our team is actively prioritizing your setup now, and we’ll have everything 
sorted and moving quickly. I’ll keep you closely updated over the next 
couple days so there’s full transparency on progress and next steps.

Appreciate your patience, and thank you for trusting us — we’ll make sure 
this is handled properly.

If you can when replying in this email thread ensure you reply all so 
Thomas and Alex can see it also.

Thomas will be able to answer any questions as he’s the one that built the 
tool. 


Best,  
Nate

Hi Joseph

Here’s a quick breakdown of pricing and how the upgrade options work:

Pricing
- Monthly: $797/month (month-to-month)
- Quarterly: $1,500 billed every 3 months (effectively $500/month)

If you start on the monthly plan, you have a grace period during the first 
few weeks where you can roll that payment directly into either:
- the quarterly plan, or  
- the annual plan  

Your initial monthly payment will be credited, so you’re not paying twice.

Grandfathered Pricing
Any plan you start now is fully grandfathered. That means:
- Your price will never increase
- You’ll keep this rate permanently, even as features and data expand

We’re releasing V2 in mid-February, and pricing will increase at that 
point. Locking in now ensures you stay on the current rate long-term.

If you’d like, I can also walk you through which plan makes the most sense 
based on how you plan to use the platform.

Monthly payment link: https://buy.stripe.com/7sY9AUc6U65w1uM36F4gg0l

Best,  
Nate

Hi Scott,

I apologize, I believe I missed this previous email from Nate regarding you
signing up!

Below I added some helpful information that can help get you familiar with
the power of our platform.

*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single
family residential construction companies in the USA* - Watch Video

<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

<https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!

Hey Ryan,

Wanted to send over a clear overview of our pricing and available options.

*Core Plan*

   -

   *$497/month*, billed quarterly
   -

   Comes out to roughly *$1,500 every 3 months*
   -

   Includes full access to the platform with unlimited usage

*Add-Ons (Optional)*

   -

   *API Access:* *$249/month*
   -

      Enables programmatic access and deeper integrations
      -

   *VIP Support:* *$249/month*
   -

      One-on-one support and calls with our team (in addition to standard
      email/Slack support)

*White-Label Option*

   -

   *$3,000/month*
   -

   Includes *up to 10 seats*
   -

   Each additional seat is *$100/month*
   -

   Full flexibility to sell it, price it, and structure it however you want
   for your clients

Happy to walk through which setup makes the most sense based on how you’re
planning to use the platform.

Let me know if you’d like to move forward and I can send over the payment
link.

Best,

Thanks
Nate

Hey, I’m curious what your perspective is on this.

Hey Seth

I saw this. Adam is running scared and is throwing out baseless statements.

We 100% do not use AudienceLab data and never have. We source compliant
data from top sources with long term irrevocable contracts.

We are not racing to the bottom on price because our cost to acquire data
is much lower than theirs due to our direct relationships and superior data
from the same source that Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 companies get their
data.

We decided internally to just not respond to the guy as hes been recently
sending out emails and running ads trying to trash us due to us signing up
2-5 people a day from audience lab.

Thanks
Nate

Thanks for the insight. Assumed he was panicking. Quick question on using
the audiences in Meta…

Should I filter for “high” match score and should I use as a custom
audience ONLY or use as an Advantage+ audience?

Oh, also, should I be using the greatest possible timeframe which I think
is around 2 weeks for the query and how often should I be refreshing them
and swapping them out on the ad set?


Thanks,
Seth

SUBJECT: Re: Rebuttal?

Hey Seth

Good questions — this stuff is a bit counterintuitive at first.

*Match score / intent score*
It’s not always best to filter strictly to the *highest* intent or match
score. In a lot of cases, that can actually over-constrain the audience and
hurt performance. We usually recommend testing a slightly broader range
rather than only the top tier.

*Custom Audience vs. Advantage+*
In most cases, you’ll want to use these as *Custom Audiences*, not
Advantage+. Advantage+ tends to override a lot of the signal you’re
intentionally injecting.
That said, you *can* split-test Custom Audience vs. Advantage+ if you want
to see how Meta handles expansion, but we generally start with Custom
Audiences only.

*Timeframe / refresh cadence*
This really depends on the buying behavior of the topic:

   -

   *Impulse or fast-decision offers* → shorter intent windows
   -

   *High-consideration purchases* (e.g., cars, real estate, expensive
   services) → longer intent windows, since people research for weeks or
   months before converting

There’s no one-size-fits-all window — the key is matching the intent
timeframe to how long people realistically take to make a decision.

Happy to look at the specific vertical you’re running and give a more exact
recommendation if helpful.


Thanks
Nate

One is hard money lending. Investors looking for real estate funding for
fix and flip projects.

The other is accredited investors looking for alternative investments,
fixed returns, diversification etc. Our minimum investment requirement on
the fund is 50K.

Hey Seth,



Based on the two audiences you outlined, below are the exact intent topics (listed verbatim from our B2B and B2C topic lists) that most closely align with your goals.






Hard Money Lending / Fix-and-Flip Investors



B2C Topics



Commercial Real Estate Financing
Asset-based Lending
Home Equity Loans
Home Equity Lines Of Credit
Mortgages
Real Estate Planning




These topics generally capture individuals actively researching real estate financing and capital solutions, which aligns well with fix-and-flip and hard money lending demand.






Accredited Investors / Alternative Investment Seekers



B2C Topics



Alternative Investment Management
Investment Management
Hedge Fund Management
Investment Advisory Services
Wealth Management
International Wealth Management
Wealth Transfer Planning
Investment Services




These topics skew toward financially sophisticated and accredited investors looking for alternative investments, diversification, and fixed-return opportunities, which fits well with your $50K minimum investment.






If you’d like, I can help narrow this down further, recommend intent windows, or structure separate campaigns for each audience.



Best,

Nate

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the

to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!

Also for reference this party did try to remove himself at the Chase
location and they said he is not able to without our permission so I'm not
sure how this should be done.

Understood, I have sent this communication over to our business relationship manager to review so that she can best direct us on how to go about this process. It is set up differently then your normal business account so we are making sure we accommodate maintenance request correctly to avoid any discrepancies with account.

Yes Ben Munger actually tried to go into chase yesterday and take himself 
off the bank account and they wouldn’t let him. So not sure what you guys 
need but we are being told completely different stories from everyone. 
Looks to get him removed as quickly as possible from the bank account as he 
is not involved or an owner of this business at all. Please let us know 
what you need from any of us including Ben so we can get this taken care of.

Thanks 
Nate

Hi Noah,

Thank you for signing up! Below I added some helpful information that can
help get you familiar with the power of our platform. Also in regards to
your question regarding I am looping in Alex our Co-founder to speak on
that!

*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single
family resident construction companies in the USA* - Watch Video
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393>
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

*Creating Targeted Audiences for Pest Control Marketing 📊* - Watch Video

<https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!

Hi Mike,

Cindy mentioned your concern with audiencelab, all I can say is I'm pretty
sure most people would be freaking out and spewing slander when we sign up
at least 5 of their clients everyday. We source our own data and it has
taken almost three years to compile all of those licenses to source them
legally (unlike some companies). I would be happy to talk to you about that
if need be!

Alex —
I spent about three hours tonight building audiences, and honestly, it wasn’t as robust as I’d hoped—especially for my primary audience of high–net-worth individuals interested in publishing a book. The numbers just weren’t there for a four day period.
I landed on a list of about 5,200, but I couldn’t get Meta to connect directly, so I manually uploaded the list to see what would happen. Meta rejected all but fewer than 1,000 records, which really isn’t enough to run a meaningful campaign. Is there a way to pull the Meta hashes in?
I appreciate your insight on this. I’m going to call it a night and pick it back up tomorrow.
— Mike

SUBJECT: Pricing & Trial Option

Hey Justus,

Wanted to send over a quick breakdown of pricing and how the trial option
works.

*Core Plan*

   -

   *$497/month, billed quarterly* (roughly *$1,500 every 3 months*)
   -

   Fully *unlimited data usage*
   -

   Includes *up to 10 website pixels*
   -

   Each additional website pixel after the first 10 is *$20/month*
   -

   At higher volumes, pixel pricing can come down as well

*Add-On*

   -

   *API Access:* *$297/month*

*Trial Option*
If you’d like to test things first, we can do a one-month trial at:

   -

   *$497 for the core plan*
   -

   *$297 for API access*

After the first month, you can roll straight into a *quarterly or annual
plan*, and everything you’ve paid will carry over—no restarting or
double-paying.

Once you’re ready to get going, just let us know and we’ll send over the
payment link. After payment, we’ll CC one of our developers on the
thread—at that point, just reply with a quick note on exactly what you’re
trying to accomplish with the API, and they’ll help get everything dialed
in.

Happy to walk through anything or answer questions.

Best,
Nate

Hello Nate,

Thank you for this information. I was expecting

*Trial Option*
If you’d like to test things first, we can do a one-month trial at:

   -

   *$497 for the core plan*
   -

   *$297 for API access*

And then roll into the quarterly subscription if the data meets our needs.
Can you please update the payment reflect the Trial Option.

Justus

Hi Justus. I just checked the call notes from your call with Nate. We don’t 
offer that anymore but since he extended that to you on the call we will 
honor it.

Payment link:  https://buy.stripe.com/7sYaEYb2QgKa2yQbDb4gg0w

Once complete just let me know and I will create your logins.

Thanks
Cindy

Hello Nate,

Thank you for this information. I was expecting 

*Trial Option*
If you’d like to test things first, we can do a one-month trial at:

   - 
   
   *$497 for the core plan*
   - 
   
   *$297 for API access*
   
And then roll into the quarterly subscription if the data meets our needs. 
Can you please update the payment reflect the Trial Option.

Justus

Hi Justus!

Thank you for signing up! Below I added some helpful information that can
help get you familiar with the power of our platform.

Login link: app.retargetiq.com/login

*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single
family residential construction companies in the USA* - Watch Video
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393>
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

<https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!

SUBJECT: Re: Pricing & Trial Option

In looking at the API documentation... I received this from my developer

""Contact Retarget IQ to confirm how to get the full response with all 50+
fields - they may have an extended endpoint or parameters""
The API documentation I fetched only shows basic fields: (name, address,
emails, phones).

Retarget IQ offers way more than what their basic API docs show. ....

Here's the full list of available markers:

Personal Contact:
First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Mobile
Additional Emails, Email Validation, Email Last Seen
LinkedIn URL, Social Connections
Address, Address 2, City, State, Zip, Zip 4, Country
Demographics:

Gender, Age, Married, Children
Income, Net Worth, Home Owner
Professional:

Job Title, Job Title Normalized, Title Last Updated
Seniority, Seniority 2, Department, Department 2
Business Email, Programmatic Email
Business Email Validation, Business Email Last Seen
Business Phone, Business Address (full)
Company:

Company Name, Company URL, Related URLs
Company Phone, Company SIC, Company NAICS
Company Address (full), Company Revenue, Company Size
Industry, Company Description
Company Last Updated, Record Last Updated, CC ID

The extended fields (demographics, job info, company data) aren't fully
documented in their public API docs. T
he basic API response only shows core contact info, but their platform
clearly has all these additional fields available.""

How can we get the API to return all of these fields (if they're available)?

Can you please provide a list of all exported files you’d like to have and 
we can make a custom api end point for you.

Thanks

In looking at the API documentation... I received this from my developer

""Contact Retarget IQ to confirm how to get the full response with all 50+ 
fields - they may have an extended endpoint or parameters""
The API documentation I fetched only shows basic fields: (name, address, 
emails, phones). 

Retarget IQ offers way more than what their basic API docs show. ....

Here's the full list of available markers:

Personal Contact:
First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, Mobile
Additional Emails, Email Validation, Email Last Seen
LinkedIn URL, Social Connections
Address, Address 2, City, State, Zip, Zip 4, Country
Demographics:

Gender, Age, Married, Children
Income, Net Worth, Home Owner
Professional:

Job Title, Job Title Normalized, Title Last Updated
Seniority, Seniority 2, Department, Department 2
Business Email, Programmatic Email
Business Email Validation, Business Email Last Seen
Business Phone, Business Address (full)
Company:

Company Name, Company URL, Related URLs
Company Phone, Company SIC, Company NAICS
Company Address (full), Company Revenue, Company Size
Industry, Company Description
Company Last Updated, Record Last Updated, CC ID

The extended fields (demographics, job info, company data) aren't fully 
documented in their public API docs. T
he basic API response only shows core contact info, but their platform 
clearly has all these additional fields available.""

How can we get the API to return all of these fields (if they're available)?

Hello! Would it be possible to create a B2C and a B2B api? If not, I would
just like an API that can call basically all 50 markers (if possible) ...
cause we'll just parse the information we need for B2B and B2C. Let me know
what you do - and we'll adjust :-)

SUBJECT: Pricing Overview

Hey Robert,

Wanted to send over a clear breakdown of our pricing and how the plans work.

*Core Plan (Non–White Label)*

   -

   *$497/month, billed quarterly* (roughly *$1,500 every 3 months*)
   -

   Fully *unlimited data usage*
   -

   Includes *up to 10 website pixels*
   -

   Each additional website pixel after the first 10 is *$20/month*
   -

   At higher volumes, pixel pricing can come down as well

This plan gives you unlimited access across the platform without
white-labeling.

*White-Label Plan*

   -

   *$3,000/month*
   -

   Includes *10 sub-accounts (seats)*
   -

   Each seat can be fully unlimited, or you can set limits and pricing
   however you’d like
   -

   You’re free to resell, package, or bill your clients however you want
   -

   Each additional sub-account beyond the included 10 is *$100/month*

That’s the full breakdown. Happy to walk through which option makes the
most sense based on how you’re planning to use or resell the platform.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed.

Best,
Nate

SUBJECT: Proposed Referral & Partnership Structure – RetargetIQ / Agency Designs / Inbox Accelerator

Guys this was made with CHATGPT all % and commissions were randomly
generated by chat gpt and are simply placeholders. Let's set up a call to
figure out what would be fair to all parties.
------------------------------

Hey Ben, Alex —

Wanted to get everything clearly laid out in one place so we can align on
structure, referrals, and economics before formalizing this into a written
agreement.

Below is a *proposed framework* covering (1) equity clarification, (2)
agency partnerships, (3) retail referrals, (4) cross-referrals between
companies, and (5) direct referrals from Ben’s network. None of this is
final — the goal is to agree on direction and percentages so we can paper
it cleanly.
------------------------------
1. Equity Clarification (RetargetIQ)

To be explicit and documented:

   -

   Ben Munger and Munger Enterprises *formally resign and waive any and all
   rights* to the previously discussed *20% equity interest in RetargetIQ*.
   -

   No ownership, profit interest, or governance rights exist or will exist
   unless explicitly agreed to in writing in the future.
   -

   All future involvement is *strictly referral-based and/or service-based*,
   not equity-based.

This will be clearly stated in the final agreement for clarity and
protection on all sides.
------------------------------
2. Agency Clients → Exclusive Partnership (Agency Designs)

*RetargetIQ Agency Users*

   -

   RetargetIQ has two customer types: *Agency* and *Retail*.
   -

   For *agency customers*, we propose an *exclusive referral partnership*
   with *Agency Designs*.

*How this works:*

   -

   When an agency signs up for RetargetIQ and needs:
   -

      White-label SEO
      -

      White-label websites
      -

      Fulfillment resources
      -

   We direct them to *Agency Designs* as our preferred / exclusive partner.

*Proposed commission:*

   -

   *10% monthly recurring commission* paid by Agency Designs to RetargetIQ
   -

   Commission applies for the life of the referred client
   -

   Applies only to services fulfilled by Agency Designs

*Support materials:*

   -

   RetargetIQ provides:
   -

      Platform walkthrough videos
      -

      Tutorials
      -

      Training assets
      -

   These can be embedded inside Agency Designs’ program to support agencies
   using RetargetIQ.

------------------------------
3. Agency Designs → RetargetIQ Referrals

*Reverse flow:*

   -

   If Agency Designs (Ben) refers an agency to RetargetIQ:
   -

      RetargetIQ pays *20% monthly recurring commission*
      -

      Applies to the RetargetIQ subscription
      -

      Paid for as long as the client remains active

------------------------------
4. Retail Clients → Real SEO Proof (Profit Split)

*Retail Clients Defined:*

   -

   Non-agency end customers needing:
   -

      Websites
      -

      SEO
      -

      Ongoing marketing

*Proposed structure:*

   -

   RetargetIQ refers retail clients to *Real SEO Proof*
   -

   *Net profit split evenly* between:
   -

      Nathan
      -

      Alex
      -

      Ben

(Net profit to be clearly defined as revenue minus direct fulfillment
costs.)

*Reverse referral (Real SEO Proof → RetargetIQ):*

   -

   If Real SEO Proof refers a client to RetargetIQ:
   -

      Proposed *15–20% monthly recurring commission*
      -

      Final % to be agreed on

------------------------------
5. Inbox Accelerator ↔ Agency Designs ↔ RetargetIQ Cross-Referrals

*Proposed baseline structure (open to adjustment):*

   -

   Agency Designs → Inbox Accelerator: *20% recurring*
   -

   Inbox Accelerator → Agency Designs: *10–15% recurring*
   -

   RetargetIQ → Inbox Accelerator: *20% recurring*
   -

   Inbox Accelerator → RetargetIQ: *20% recurring*

------------------------------
6. Direct Referrals From Ben’s Network (All Client Types)

We also want to clearly define *direct referrals from Ben personally*,
regardless of company.

*Scenario:*

   -

   If Ben refers someone from his personal or professional network directly
   to RetargetIQ — whether they are:
   -

      Agencies
      -

      Enterprise clients
      -

      Retail clients
      -

      Or any other deal type

We should establish a *standard referral commission* for those
introductions.

*Proposed structure (for discussion):*

   -

   *20% monthly recurring commission* on RetargetIQ subscriptions
   -

   Applies regardless of client category
   -

   Paid for the duration of the customer’s active subscription
   -

   This is separate from Agency Designs–specific referrals

Happy to adjust this if enterprise deals require different economics.
------------------------------
7. General Commission Terms (Proposed)

   -

   Monthly recurring commissions
   -

   Paid while the customer remains active and paying
   -

   No commission stacking unless explicitly agreed
   -

   Clear attribution rules
   -

   Either party may terminate referrals prospectively with written notice
   -

   No retroactive clawbacks

------------------------------
Next Steps

At this point, we really just need to:

   1.

   *Lock the commission percentages*
   2.

   Finalize *which relationships are exclusive*
   3.

   Agree on *definitions (agency vs retail, net profit, attribution)*

Once aligned, we can:

   -

   Create a *simple commission table* so everything is crystal clear
   -

   Track referrals via:
   -

      Dedicated calendar links, and/or
      -

      A shared tracking spreadsheet

From there, we formalize everything into a single clean agreement.

Let me know thoughts, changes, or pushback and we’ll dial this in.

– Nathan

1) Unlimited data
2) Unlimited pixels across multiple websites that allow me to track and a

3) Some sort of mechanism in real time so the new leads from the keywords

Hopefully it has campaigns built for organization.

If you want to add api as well let me know and I’ll shoot over stuff for 
that.

Let me know once this is taken care of and we’ll generate your login and 
shoot over your credentials.

Once paid you’ll get access very quickly. Anywhere from a couple minutes

Website identification you’ll get anywhere from 30-70%+ website visitors 
identified (range depends on source of website traffic) usually see 40-50% 
on average. 

Let me know if you have any other questions or need us to shoot over that

1) Unlimited data
2) Unlimited pixels across multiple websites that allow me to track and a

3) Some sort of mechanism in real time so the new leads from the keywords

Hopefully it has campaigns built for organization.

Hi Noah,

Thank you for signing up! Below I added some helpful information that can
help get you familiar with the power of our platform.

<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!


Thanks,

SUBJECT: Lucerne & AudienceLabs

Nate,

When did our call, I asked if this was Lucerne data/source. You mentioned
it wasnt.
You didn't know Lucerne, but we discussed it not being the same as
AudienceLabs.

1. I will never work with Lucerne because I know who he is as a person
2. If your data is the same, I need to know because it won't work

Please email me and verify this isn't the same data as Lucerne. If it is,
we're out.
I want nothing to do with anything Lucerne is a part of.

Please verify.

Scott Heistand

Hey Scott,

I want to make it very clear. We 100% do not use any audience lab data and
never have.

We source compliant data from top sources with long term irrevocable
contracts

We have a enterprise cloud provider who works with large data companies,
most prominently clay.com

Adam Lucerne has been attacking us via commenting on our ads and sending
out crazy emails to his customer list and email list bashing us.

Not a single thing this guy says is accurate and we are being the bigger
person and not responding.

We will let him continue to act crazy. Ignore him and disregard anything he
says.

Nate,

Thanks for verifying.

Yeah, we're close to a couple of Adam's old business partners. I guess you
know
now why I was adamant about your side not being associated with him.

I appreciate the clarity. He'll burn his business down in time.

I hope your service is great and that you scoop up every last one of his
clients.

Have a great weekend.

Scott

SUBJECT: Pricing and Summary

Hey Kyle,

Wanted to clearly outline RetargetIQ pricing so you can see everything
side-by-side.
------------------------------
*RetargetIQ – Standard Platform*

   -

   *$1,500 per month, billed quarterly* ($4,500 every 3 months)
   -

   *Unlimited everything* — unlimited website identification, enrichment,
   and data usage
   -

   *Grandfathered pricing* — once you’re in at this rate, it will never
   increase, even as the platform continues to expand

This is our core platform with no record caps or throttling.

*Upgrade flexibility:*
If you start on the quarterly plan, you have a *2-week window* to roll that
payment into:

   -

   *Annual plan — $5,000 paid upfront for the year*, or
   -

   *White label*, with your quarterly payment credited (details below)

Nothing you pay is lost if you decide to upgrade quickly.
------------------------------
*RetargetIQ – White Label Platform*

   -

   *$2,997 per month*
   -

   Includes *10 sub-accounts*
   -

   *Each additional sub-account is a one-time $100 fee* (not monthly)
   -

   Fully white-labeled under your brand
   -

      Your logo
      -

      Your domain
      -

      Your branding
      -

      Your client-facing dashboards
      -

      Your API documentation

With white label, you have *complete freedom*:

   -

   Set your own pricing (per seat, per record, unlimited, tiered plans,
   etc.)
   -

   Upsell API access, data packages, or premium services however you want
   -

   Sell to agencies, internal teams, or end clients
   -

   No restrictions on how you package or monetize the platform

Many partners price this anywhere from a few hundred per seat to several
thousand per account — it’s entirely up to you.
------------------------------
*V2 Platform Upgrade Credit*

Once the *V2 platform update* goes live:

   -

   If you *roll over your quarterly plan into white label*, or
   -

   If you *upgrade directly to white label*,

We will *credit the $1,500 you’ve already paid* toward your white-label
subscription.

This lets you start on the standard platform now and seamlessly move into
white label later without losing any upfront investment.

If you want, I’m happy to walk through real-world pricing examples or how
other partners structure their offers.

Best,
Nate

HI Nate,

Thank you for the correction on the standard platform, also for clarity
say, I see the white label platform is the same cost from the first email,
is that cost actually lower as well than what is shown here?

SUBJECT: Pricing and Call Recap and Intent Topics List

Hey Brian,

Wanted to clearly outline RetargetIQ pricing so you can see everything
side-by-side.
------------------------------
*RetargetIQ – Standard Platform*

   -

   *$1,500 per month, billed quarterly* ($4,500 every 3 months)
   -

   *Unlimited everything* — unlimited website identification, enrichment,
   and data usage
   -

   *Grandfathered pricing* — once you’re in at this rate, it will never
   increase, even as the platform continues to expand

This is our core platform with no record caps or throttling.
------------------------------
*RetargetIQ – White Label Platform*

   -

   *$2,997 per month*
   -

   Includes *10 sub-accounts*
   -

   *Each additional sub-account is a one-time $100 fee* (not monthly)
   -

   Fully white-labeled under your brand
   -

      Your logo
      -

      Your domain
      -

      Your branding
      -

      Your client-facing dashboards
      -

      Your API documentation

With white label, you have *complete freedom*:

   -

   Set your own pricing (per seat, per record, unlimited, tiered plans,
   etc.)
   -

   Upsell API access, data packages, or premium services however you want
   -

   Sell to agencies, internal teams, or end clients
   -

   No restrictions on how you package or monetize the platform

Many partners price this anywhere from a few hundred per seat to several
thousand per account — it’s entirely up to you.
------------------------------
*V2 Platform Upgrade Credit*

Once the *V2 platform update* goes live:

   -

   If you *roll over your quarterly plan into white label*, or
   -

   If you *upgrade directly to white label*,

We will *credit the $1,500 you’ve already paid* toward your white-label
subscription.

This makes it easy to start on the standard plan now and transition into
white label later without losing anything you’ve already invested.

Let me know if you want me to walk through examples of how partners are
pricing or packaging this — happy to break that down.

Hey Danny just putting this in writing for you. If you decide you want to
roll over the Quarterly amount into whitelabel. You will be able to do so
and have the entire amount credited towards the whitelabel plan until the
new V2 platform release comes out. Once it comes out you will have a week
to roll that over to get the amount credited.

Hey Adam

Great speaking with you earlier today.

As promised, here’s a quick breakdown of the pricing options we discussed
so you have everything in writing:

*Platform Pricing*

   -

   *Month-to-Month:* $749/month
   (No long-term commitment, fully flexible)
   -

   *Quarterly Plan:* $497/month, billed quarterly
   ($1,491 every 3 months)
   -

   *Annual Plan:* $5,000/year
   (Best value and lowest effective monthly rate)

*Optional Add-Ons*

   -

   *API Access:* $297/month
   -

   *VIP Support:* $297/month
   (Direct 1-on-1 access with our team for implementation, strategy, and
   ongoing optimization)

If you decide to start month-to-month, there’s also a short window to
upgrade into a quarterly or annual plan and have your initial payment
credited toward that plan.

Let me know which option makes the most sense for you, or if you want to
walk through anything in more detail. Happy to get everything set up right
away.

Best,
Nate

Hello Jon, Alex, Nate,It was a pleasure to connect with you yesterday.
mTap has two major use cases for enrichment1. Name & Company Name: This will be
primarily used at the conference as we scan the badges.2. Name and Email:  This
is the regular usage when you meet people
Please also share the B2B endpoints that you have.
We called the email API for 18,304 contacts and only got the business data for
548. I am hoping that by using waterfall strategies the enrichment can be at
least 40% and not 3% as of right now.
​​

Looking forward working with you.

Can you please as mentioned yesterday on the call provide an in

and exactly what output fields you want for the enrichment and any sort of
specific steps or processes you want it to follow and we will build a

SUBJECT: RetargetIQ Pricing Overview

Hi Jahanzeb,

As promised, below is a full breakdown of *RetargetIQ pricing* so you can
see all options clearly.
------------------------------
*Standard Plan*

*$497 per month, billed quarterly*
($1,491 every 3 months)

Includes:

   -

   Full access to the RetargetIQ platform
   -

   Website visitor identification (entire site covered by one pixel)
   -

   Audience builder & enrichment tools
   -

   Unlimited usage (no per-record fees)

*Optional Add-Ons*

   -

   *API Access:* $297/month
   -

   *VIP Support:* $297/month (1-on-1 calls with our team)

------------------------------
*Month-to-Month Option*

*$749 per month*

This option is ideal if you’d like to test the platform before committing
longer term.

If you upgrade to the *Quarterly or Annual plan within the first 14 days*,
we’ll *credit the $749 you paid* toward that plan, so you’re not paying
twice.
------------------------------
*Annual Plan*

*$5,000 per year*

   -

   Best value overall
   -

SUBJECT: Intent Topic List + Pricing Summary

Hey Nick,

Great connecting earlier. I wanted to quickly outline the pricing we
discussed for *RetargetIQ* so you have everything in writing.

*Pricing*

   -

   *$497/month, billed quarterly*
   -

   That comes out to *$1,500 every 3 months*
   -

   This pricing is *fully unlimited* (no record caps) and includes full
   platform access

We can *honor this pricing until end of day next Friday*. After that, once
our upcoming platform update rolls out, pricing will increase to
*$997/month* for new customers.

*Locking in the price*
If you don’t want to fully start using the platform until March, you have
two options:

   1.

   *Pay a deposit now*, which will be fully credited toward your
   subscription once you start, or
   2.

   *Pay in full now and delay platform access until March*

Either way, the key benefit is that you’ll be *permanently grandfathered in*
at the $497/month rate.

That means:

   -

   Your price *never increases* — even if pricing later moves to
   $2,000–$3,000/month
   -

   You keep *unlimited data access forever*
   -

   If/when we introduce record caps in the future, you’ll remain on an
*uncapped,
   unlimited plan*

Let me know what makes the most sense for you, and I’m happy to get
everything set up.

Hi Greg!

Thank you for signing up! Please let me know if this will help you with any
questions you may have. If not I can make some custom loom videos regarding
specific questions or issues you may have. Below I added some helpful
information that can help get you familiar with the power of our platform.


*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single
family residential construction companies in the USA* - Watch Video
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393>
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

*Creating Targeted Audiences for Pest Control Marketing 📊* - Watch Video

<https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!


Thank you,

Cindy

Hey Greg!

Super simple, just send over that list to this email and we can go and
enrich it for the specific field you are looking for. When our V2 platform
drops this will be possible within the system on your end.


Thanks,

Cindy

SUBJECT: Pricing Summary and Next Steps

Here’s a clean, client-ready pricing email you can send. I corrected the
wording so it’s clear that *$497/month is billed quarterly (~$1,500 per
quarter)*.

Hey Jason,

Following up to outline the pricing we discussed:

*Core Platform*

   -

   *$497 per month, billed quarterly*
   -

   That comes out to *approximately $1,500 every 3 months*
   -

   Quarterly billing is required for this plan

*Optional Add-Ons*

   -

   *API Access:* $297 per month
   -

   *Priority Support:* $297 per month
   (Priority support gives you one-on-one access with our team on live
   calls, in addition to standard Slack/email support.)

*Quarterly → Annual Upgrade Incentive*

   -

   If you upgrade from the *quarterly plan to the annual plan within the
   first 2 weeks*, we will:
   -

      *Credit 100% of your quarterly payment toward the annual plan*
      -

      *Include API access for free for the entire year*

Let me know if you’d like to move forward or if you want help deciding
which add-ons make the most sense for your use case.

Best,
Nate

Quick question for you as chatgpt isn't seeing the intent categories we
would want to target directly in your lists.  Is there a way to stack
categories to get the intent info we are really searching for?  Where the
results are only if they meet all requirements?

Example: Construction (main b2b category) + (Meets at least one of these)
Commercial Vehicle, Workplace safety, Project Management, Compliance &
Licensing = our list

Or is there a way to get custom intent categories that would work for our
specific use case?

Thanks Nate!

Hi Jason,

Great question — and sorry for the delay getting back to you here.

At the moment, you can’t natively “stack” intent categories inside the
platform in a strict AND/OR logic (e.g., Construction *AND* Commercial
Vehicle *AND* Workplace Safety). The best current approach is to pull each
relevant intent category separately and then overlap or intersect those
lists externally — typically in Excel, Google Sheets, or via a large
language model to narrow the audience down to only the companies that meet
all of your criteria.

That said, there are a couple of good options we can explore for your use
case:

   -

   *Custom audience build* – We may be able to create a tailored audience
   that aligns closely with your exact intent logic. I’ll loop this over to
   our technical team to confirm what’s possible on the backend.
   -

   *Keyword-based intent (coming soon)* – We’re actively working on
   keyword-level intent targeting, which will be released in our V2 update.
   This will allow much more precise intent definitions that should fit
   scenarios like yours extremely well.

I’ll send this over to our technical team and get a definitive answer for
you on the custom audience side. I’ll follow up as soon as I have clarity.

Appreciate the thoughtful question — and thanks for your patience.

Best,
Nate

Hi Nate,

Thank you for the clarification on this. I would love to get the keyword
update timeframe as I think that would solve our problem. I know that was
one of the things that Audience Lab had. I know they are more expensive
than you are right now but they do have that feature plus the white label
at a cheaper per month price than you guys.

My concern is paying that much right away before I can validate the
business model. Your pricing is more in line with what I'm willing to spend
to do a test run but I also need the results of the data to be what we need.

Thank you again for getting back to me and for asking the development team
about the keyword rollout timeframe.

Hi Nate,

I had a few more questions as I have talked to several other competitors so
I want to make sure I am clear on your product specs.

1) For the $497 per month(quarterly) there are no data caps for the info we
pull?

2) We can set up unlimited saved lists that can be auto scheduled to pull
each week?

3) Once a list is generated, can it be automatically sent to us via API or
would it need to be downloaded manually or emailed to us?

4) Do you have an estimated launch date for V2 with keyword intent?

5) I think you said that deduping happened per list, is there any way to
dedupe versus prior weeks lists?  We want our accounts to be fresh and
never duplicated.  If not, we can figure it out on our side with a master
account list.

Could you also send me a screenshot of the filters so I can look at how we
set up a query again?  This can be blank as I just want to see all of the
filter categories again.

Thank you,

Jason Thoerner

SUBJECT: Re: Pricing Summary and Next Steps

Hi Jason,

Happy to clarify — totally makes sense to sanity-check everything.

   1.

   *Data caps*
   Correct. On the *$497/month plan (billed quarterly)* there are *no data
   caps* on what you pull. It’s fully unlimited.
   2.

   *Saved lists & scheduling*
   Yes — you can create *unlimited saved lists* and auto-schedule them to
   run on *whatever cadence you want* (daily, weekly, etc.).
   3.

   *Delivery once a list is generated*
   Today, once a list is generated, you can:


   -

   Manually download it, or
   -

   Push it directly into an ad account from inside the platform

Inside saved queries, if you click *View*, you’ll see a dropdown where you
can schedule the query or push it straight to an ad account.

Full list-level automation via *API* (so everything runs end-to-end without
manual steps) will be part of *V2*. Once that’s live, you’ll be able to
handle the entire workflow through API if you prefer.

   4.

   *V2 launch (keyword intent)*
   V2 is scheduled to launch on *February 15th*.
   This release includes:


   -

   *Keyword intent*
   -

   *Competitor website identification*, where you can input specific
   competitor domains, URLs, or even individual pages and capture users
   visiting those sites


   5.

   *Deduping*
   Can you clarify what you’re looking for in terms of cross-week or
   cross-list deduping? Want to make sure I fully understand your workflow so
   I can give you the most accurate answer. Either way, what you described
   with a master suppression list on your side is absolutely doable as well.

As for filter screenshots — all available filters are visible directly in
the *Build List* dropdown inside the platform. A screenshot would
essentially just mirror what you see there, but I’m happy to walk through
it live or point you to anything specific if helpful.

Let me know if you want to dig deeper on any of this.

Best,
Nate

SUBJECT: Re: Pricing Summary and Next Steps

Hi Nate,

Thank you for the answers.

On the dedupe topic. My end game is that I don't want to run a list and
keep getting the same data returned week after week.

On the filter list, I was wanting a screenshot so I could look at what the
filters were that I can work with. Doesn't need to be a screenshot if you
don't want to send that to me but a list of the filters we can use would be
great.

One last question, are there set fields that each list will return to us?
And if I remember correctly we can choose which fields to include in our
list?

I am trying to get this figured out so I can move forward within the next
week. Working on our mvp already.

Thank you,

Jason Thoerner

Hey Vigen

My apologies for the delay. Here is the pricing recap we discussed:

Monthly plan: $749/month (true month-to-month)

Quarterly plan: $497/month, billed quarterly (roughly $1,500 every 3 months)

If you start on the monthly plan, you'll have a one-week window to upgrade
to the quarterly plan, and anything you've already paid will be prorated
and credited toward the quarterly billing.

Optional Add-Ons

VIP Support: $297/month
API Access: $297/month

Both add-ons can be added at any time.

We can guarantee this pricing through end of day Friday.

Let me know if you have any questions or want to get started.

Thanks
Nate

Hey Nate, Happy Monday!

My apologies for the delay in getting back to you, after discussing the
product over the weekend with Art, we are ready to proceed with onboarding
starting 2/1/26.

We want to start off clean on the first of the month for our internal
billing purposes and are looking to go ahead with the $1500 for the first
quarter to start with.

Just to confirm, the price is $1500 (tax and fees included ?) all in for 3
months, no auto renew right ? Also, what else would be needed to get going
day one on 2/1 ?

Let me know at your earliest convenience and thank you again!

Hey Vigen — happy Monday, and thanks for the update.

Yes, that all sounds great. To confirm the details:

- Pricing: $1,500 total for the first quarter (3 months of access). No 
additional taxes or fees on top of that.
- Access: Once the $1,500 payment is completed, your login will be 
generated and sent over shortly after — typically within a few minutes, and 
no longer than a couple of hours.
- Start date: We’ll align access to begin on 2/1, so everything starts 
cleanly at the beginning of the month.

Renewal & flexibility:
- The quarterly plan does auto-renew, but you can cancel anytime as long as 
you let us know at least 14 days before the next billing date.
- For example, if you start on 2/1, the next billing would be around 5/1 — 
just notify us by mid-April and you won’t be billed again.
- Within the first two weeks, you also have the option to:
  - Roll this into an annual plan to save money, or  
  - Upgrade to white-label, in which case we’ll credit the amount you’ve 
already paid toward the upgraded plan (as long as it’s within that initial 
two-week window).

Day-one requirements:
There’s nothing additional needed on your end to get started. We’ll send 
over a payment link, you complete payment, and we’ll handle login creation 
and access from there.

Let me know once you’re ready and I’ll send over the payment link so we can 
get everything set up for February 1.

Looking forward to working together.

Best,  
Nate

Thanks Nate!

Had just one final question, with the super pixel and high intent data that
we will be getting from the platform, is all of it compliant with the
latest TCPA, FCC and the National DNC database ?

We need to limit all potential liabilities from these regulations whether
the data is for us or for our clients.

Let me know, thanks man!

Everything is 100% legal. We have lots of enterprise companies using our
platform. Please check the footer of our website for all the legal/privacy
documentation. We do recommend best practices IF YOU DO use phone numbers
regardless if its our platform or any platform run them through the
National DNC list. We have already done this but our platform has almost 2
Billion phone numbers so the standard rule of thumb is to do this
regardless of the platform that you pull your data from.

Hey Scott,

Great speaking with you earlier — wanted to send over a quick recap so you
have everything clearly outlined.

*Plan & Pricing*

   -

   *Quarterly plan:* $497/month, billed quarterly
   (Roughly *$1,500 every 3 months*)

This is the plan we discussed on the call.

*Optional Add-Ons*

   -

   *VIP Support:* $297/month
   (One-on-one Google Meet sessions with our team for setup help, pulling
   lists, strategy, etc.)
   -

   *API Access:* $297/month
   (Full enterprise API access for automation and integrations)

Both add-ons are completely optional and can be added at any point in the
future.

We can *guarantee the pricing discussed today through end of day Friday*.

Let me know if you’d like to move forward or if any questions come up —
happy to help.

Best,
Nate

Nate,

Thanks for the call.

I'm going to set up the account Friday.

I'm meeting with our Devs Thursday to discuss implementation.
Can you share any public API documentation so we can plan
and have as little ""manual"" effort as possible?

Please email me a sign up link Thursday if possible.

Thank you,

Hi Scott,

Thanks again for the call.

Sounds good on your end. I’m glad you were able to find the API
documentation on the site — that will cover the majority of the
implementation and should keep things as automated as possible. If your dev
team has any specific questions after reviewing it, feel free to send them
over and I’m happy to clarify.

I’ll send you the signup link by Thursday as requested, and once that’s
completed we’ll have the account fully set up on Friday. Just as a heads
up, the pricing we discussed is guaranteed through end of day Friday.

When I send the payment link on Thursday, just let me know whether you’re
planning to move forward with API access or if you’re just looking to start
with the core platform, so I know which link to send over.

Looking forward to getting this live. Let me know if anything else would be
helpful ahead of your dev meeting.

Best,
Nate

SUBJECT: Post Call Summary + Next Steps

Hey Guys,

Great speaking with you earlier — wanted to quickly recap everything we
covered so you have it all in one place.

*Pricing Options*

   -

   *Monthly plan:* $749/month (true month-to-month)
   -

   *Quarterly plan:* $497/month, billed quarterly (roughly $1,500 every 3
   months)

If you start on the *monthly plan*, you’ll have a *one-week window* to
upgrade to the quarterly plan, and anything you’ve already paid will
be *prorated
and credited toward the quarterly billing*.

*Optional Add-Ons*

   -

   *VIP Support:* $297/month
   (One-on-one Google Meet sessions with our team for setup help, pulling
   lists, strategy, etc.)
   -

   *API Access:* $297/month
   (Full enterprise API access for automation and integrations)

Both add-ons can be added at any time — nothing is required upfront.

We can *guarantee the pricing we discussed today through end of day Friday*.

Also, if you’re currently using AudienceLab and your plan runs through the
end of the month, I’d recommend getting started sooner rather than later.
That way, you can pull lists *side-by-side* in both platforms and directly
compare the *quality and depth of the data* before making a full switch.

Let me know if you’d like to get started or if any questions come up —
happy to help.

Best,
Nate

Hi Bennet,

Perfect timing! Thank you for signing up! Below I added some helpful
information that can help get you familiar with the power of our platform.

Login link: app.retargetiq.com/login
User: Bennet@appointment-gurus.com
Pass: BennetRocks123


*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single
family residential construction companies in the USA* - Watch Video
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393>
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

<https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!




Sincerely,

Cindy

Can you please advise?

Good Morning team, we're in a very delicate position considering we want to
see the quality of data so that we can effectively cancel our subscription
to Audience lab by Thursday. We need to resolve this today to give us
enough time to handle all of this.

Thanks,

Hi Bennet,

From the queries you sent me it looks like there are too many filtering
parameters which is dissolving these lists to have barely any if not zero
results. I would filter with less rules and also ensure that SIC codes are
inputted as Company SIC (in) 5812 for example.


Sincerely,

Alex Ciereszko

Hello Alex,

Thank you for your response. Can you please provide us with the exact steps
on how we can pull data of Federal Employees from the platform? We are
looking for Federal Employees that work for the agencies where I provided
the SIC codes.

Thank you!

Sincerely,

Hi Bennet,

I attached the following screenshot on the static side with information
that I would be pulling. You can use these filters on both the B2B and B2C
side as well. Please be aware that the more filters you are applying the
smaller the audience will become if not zero.


Sincerely,

Alex Ciereszko

Hey Seth, have you used your first pixel? Is this a second pixel?

If so just go to the website tab on the left hand menu and click add new.
This will generate a pixel that can either be installed in your website
global header or Google Tag Manager.

Let me know if you have any issues.

Right now we are currently offering email support and are shortly going to
move over mainly to slack. We will keep you updated.

Thanks
Cindy

Slack invites. Can I give my boss his own login to the admin portal as well?

SUBJECT: Onboarding + Payment Link

Here’s a clean, professional follow-up you can send to Zach. It’s clear,
low-friction, and reinforces how simple onboarding is.

Hey Zach,

Great speaking with you earlier. Apologies I'm sending this to your other
email. The one that was sent in the google meet chat gpt didn't get copied
correctly on my end.

Here’s the payment link for the *$497/month plan, billed quarterly*.

Once that’s taken care of, we’ll immediately send over:

   -

   Your login credentials
   -

   A few short walkthrough videos to help you get started

The setup is very straightforward. After logging in, you’ll simply:

   1.

   Create your SuperPixel
   2.

   Add it to your website (or a client’s website)
   3.

   Start accessing the data right away

If at any point you’d like additional help, we do offer *VIP Support* for
*$297/month*, which gives you one-on-one Google Meet sessions with someone
from our team (help pulling lists, setup guidance, strategy, etc.).

We also offer *API access* for *$297/month* if you want to automate or
integrate the data into your own systems. Both of these can be added at any
time—just let us know and we’ll enable them for you.

Let me know once payment is complete and we’ll get everything over to you
right away.

Best,
Nate

Hey Nate.

Let me know once you take care of this and I'll send over your login within
a few minutes of payment along with some onboarding resources and videos.

SUBJECT: Re: Onboarding + Payment Link

Hi Zach,

Here’s a quick breakdown of the month-to-month option and how upgrades work.

*Monthly Plan (Month-to-Month)*
• *$749 per month*
• No long-term commitment
• Full access to the core platform

*Optional Add-Ons*
• *API Access:* $297/month
• *VIP Support:* $297/month (1-on-1 calls with our team)

If you decide within your *first two weeks* that you’d like to move to a
longer-term plan, we’ll *credit the $749 you paid* toward either option
below — so you’re not paying twice:

*Quarterly Plan*
• $497/month, billed quarterly
• Your initial monthly payment is fully credited if you upgrade within 14
days

*Annual Plan*
• *$5,000 per year*
• Same credit applies if you upgrade within the first two weeks

A lot of teams start on monthly just to test things for a week or two, see
the data quality, audience performance, and cost-per-lead improvements —
then switch to quarterly, annual, or even white-label once they’re
confident it makes sense.

Let me know how you’d like to proceed and I can send over the appropriate
payment link.

Best,
Nate

Good morning Team,

Hope you're well.

I have been experiencing difficulty using the intent data feature.

Whenever I attempt an intent data search the platform indicates it may take
several minutes. However, I have waited several hours at a time and still
received nothing.

Please advise.

Best Regards,

Aaron

Hi Aaron!

It's actually generated within a few seconds but when you get this message
when making a new list please navigate to the left hand column that says
all audiences. This audience will be ready to go in there. Please let me

Hi Cindy,

Hope you're well.

How do I export leads?

I conducted a B2C intent data pull using the ""Virtual Assistant"" keyword
and pulled 154K prospects.

I have saved the query so that I could ""Download All"" and export but I'm
having difficulty doing so.

How do I do that?

Best Regards,

Aaron

Hi Aaron!

Once you create a list please click download all in the top right corner.
This will then become a saved query. You can locate saved queries on the
left hand side drop down under ""Audiences"". Please select ""Preview"" on the
audience which will open it. Then please click the download button I
displayed here in the attached screenshot. Please let me know if this makes
sense!

I hope you all are having a great week.

Cindy, can I book into your support calendar for a quick start meeting
later this week or so. I got taken down by the flu after signing up and
have lots of tasks to catchup and do. I want to be especially thorough with
Retarget IQ. Can you please send me your calendar. Thanks.

Hi David,

Cindy you can disregard I will get on with David. Normally we don't do any
support calls without you having our support plan but since the flu really
sucks and I'd love to catch you up to speed!

Is there a specific time that works for you next week? My calendar is
completely filled for this week unfortunately.

Let me know and I look forward to connecting!


Sincerely,

Alex Ciereszko


Know a business? Refer us for up to $1,000 in recurring commission!

Hey, I’m so sorry man I set up the alarm and I never hit the save button and then because I never got a notification. I jumped to another thing so I just realized I missed it.

Are we able to jump on our call this evening or do you want to do it tomorrow?

Sorry Dan. I’m on calls from 7am to 8pm everyday for last two weeks. It’s 
been a little crazy. I’m going to CC Jon one of our team members in here he 
will be able to meet with you tomorrow and he’s even more knowledgeable 
than me.

Thanks

Dan,
I am so sorry to do this last minute, but our tech team accidentally pushed
our planned update early, and our system is currently paused for
maintenance. With that being said, would you be able to reschedule tomorrow
so we can provide you with a proper demo of the platform? Again, so sorry
for this last minute change, but we promise it will 100% be worth the wait!

Best,
Jonathan Kluger
Chief Revenue Officer

Hey guys,

We didn’t get a chance to dive deep into what’s available for intent for AI automation for healthcare facilities.

Looking for all of US.

We didn’t know what the code would be for that.

How many are in the last 2 weeks? And 1 week?

And confirming what Jon and I spoke about. There were two items for mental health Services. One was mental health services and the other was mental health psychiatric. And we believe that everything in mental health psychiatric is also within mental health services. Meaning mental health services will be the overarching condition With the entire list, whereas psychiatric might be a smaller list that still lies inside mental health services. I hope I’m making sense. Please confirm.

FROM: Dan Nguyen <dpnguyen90@gmail.com>
TO: Jon Kluger <jon@retargetiq.com>, Alex Ciereszko <alex@retargetiq.com>
CC: Nate Calhoun <nate@retargetiq.com>
DATE: Sat Jan 24 2026 01:47:57 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)
SUBJECT: Re: Accepted: Invitation from an unknown sender: Danny Nguyen Intro Call @ Fri Jan 16, 2026 3:30pm - 4:15pm (MST) (dpnguyen90@gmail.com)

Hey Alex,

This was the email I sent after my convo with Jon:

We didn’t get a chance to dive deep into what’s available for intent for AI automation for healthcare facilities. I have an AI medical front desk automation business. Would love to know the codes for that.

**I’m also adding that I would like to know the code for a social media content marketing agency**

Looking for all of US.

We didn’t know what the code would be for that.

How many are in the last 2 weeks? And 1 week?

And confirming what Jon and I spoke about. There were two items for mental health Services. One was mental health services and the other was mental health psychiatric. And we believe that everything in mental health psychiatric is also within mental health services. Meaning mental health services will be the overarching condition With the entire list, whereas psychiatric might be a smaller list that still lies inside mental health services. I hope I’m making sense. Please confirm.

With that being said, would you be able to reschedule tomorrow so we can provide you with a proper demo of the platform? Again, so sorry for this last minute change, but we promise it will 100% be worth the wait!

DATE: Sat Jan 24 2026 02:02:26 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)
SUBJECT: Re: Accepted: Invitation from an unknown sender: Danny Nguyen Intro Call @ Fri Jan 16, 2026 3:30pm - 4:15pm (MST) (dpnguyen90@gmail.com)

Hey Dan,

No problem, I will go through and see which ones would best match this
criteria and let you know how many records we have for that.

In the meantime that list of intent signals I attached is a good reference
for any other topics you might be interested in!

We will be implementing search terms as well shortly, terms like “best ai
company” “best roofers near me” etc. just FYI.


Sincerely,

Alex Ciereszko

Hey Danny,

These lists have about 1,000,000+ records. Unfortunately I can't pull lists
for free but I can see that they have a ton of records. Would you like me
to get you set up on our month to month plan that can be rolled into
quarterly?


Sincerely,

Alex Ciereszko

Hi Nate,
I wanted to advise that I am interested in moving forward.   I do have a concern that RetargetIQ is not yet able to API integrate with Meta-   Can you advise as to when this will happen?
 
I want to be sure I understand where your platform stands with this integration, and can you share a list of all integrations Retarget IQ currently can align, as well as a future state of upcoming integrations and when those will go live.
 
I appreciate your help and look forward to making this happen and using your platform.
 
 
 
Best regards,

Hi Shannon,

Thanks for the note — really appreciate you sharing your interest in moving
forward.

Great timing as well, as I just received an update on this. We are
releasing a *native Meta audience integration* that allows you to push
audiences directly from RetargetIQ into Meta Ads *within the platform* (no
manual exports required). This is scheduled to go live *next week*. Once
live, you’ll be able to build, refresh, and sync audiences natively.

To give you a clear view of where the platform stands today, here’s a
high-level overview of our current and near-term integrations:

*Website Identification & Enrichment*

   -

   Real-time website visitor identification (B2B & B2C)
   -

   Enrichment across firmographic, demographic, and behavioral data

*CRM & Marketing Integrations (Live)*

   -

   GoHighLevel
   -

   Salesforce
   -

   HubSpot
   -

   Pipedrive
   -

   Klaviyo
   -

   Beehiiv

*Ad Platforms*

   -

   Meta Ads: website identification and retargeting already live
   -

   Google Ads: website identification and retargeting already live
   -

   *Meta native audience sync:* releasing next week

*API & Automation*

   -

   Full enterprise-grade API access
   -

   All website identification and enrichmen can be automated via API
   -

   Enables syncing into outbound workflows (email, LinkedIn, CRMs, custom
   systems, etc.)

In short, anything related to website identification, enrichment, and
downstream activation can already be fully automated today, with the native
Meta audience connector being the final piece that’s about to ship.

Happy to walk through the Meta workflow or API use cases live if helpful.
Let me know.

Best regards,

Nate

Offer ends today at Midnight. But next week we still running $497/m but 
requires quarterly billing or it’s $749/m for month to month.

Wish I could extend it to you till Monday but the owners said we have to be 
fair to all prospects that were told today is the cut off. So just let me 
know what you want to do. Either way works.

Let me know once you take care of this and Cindy will shoot over your login.

Also let me know if you guys want API Access ($297/m) or VIP support 
($297/m).

Just take care of that payment tonight and you’ll be grandfathered-in.

This is done.
 
Let's do a walk through of the API on Monday, I'll be able to decide if I want that added at that point, as there is no way I can pay for it, with the link you provided.

Hi Shannon,

Thanks for the note — really appreciate you sharing your interest in moving 
forward.

Great timing as well, as I just received an update on this. We are 
releasing a *native Meta audience integration* that allows you to push 
audiences directly from RetargetIQ into Meta Ads *within the platform* (no 
manual exports required). This is scheduled to go live *next week*. Once 
live, you’ll be able to build, refresh, and sync audiences natively.

To give you a clear view of where the platform stands today, here’s a 
high-level overview of our current and near-term integrations:

*Website Identification & Enrichment*

   - 
   
   Real-time website visitor identification (B2B & B2C)
   - 
   
   Enrichment across firmographic, demographic, and behavioral data
   
*CRM & Marketing Integrations (Live)*

   - 
   
   GoHighLevel
   - 
   
   Salesforce
   - 
   
   HubSpot
   - 
   
   Pipedrive
   - 
   
   Klaviyo
   - 
   
   Beehiiv
   
*Ad Platforms*

   - 
   
   Meta Ads: website identification and retargeting already live
   - 
   
   Google Ads: website identification and retargeting already live
   - 
   
   *Meta native audience sync:* releasing next week
   
*API & Automation*

   - 
   
   Full enterprise-grade API access
   - 
   
   All website identification and enrichmen can be automated via API
   - 
   
   Enables syncing into outbound workflows (email, LinkedIn, CRMs, custom 
   systems, etc.)
   
In short, anything related to website identification, enrichment, and 
downstream activation can already be fully automated today, with the native 
Meta audience connector being the final piece that’s about to ship.

Happy to walk through the Meta workflow or API use cases live if helpful. 
Let me know.

Best regards,

Nate

Hi Nate,
I wanted to advise that I am interested in moving forward.   I do have a 
concern that RetargetIQ is not yet able to API integrate with Meta-   Can 
you advise as to when this will happen?
 
I want to be sure I understand where your platform stands with this 
integration, and can you share a list of all integrations Retarget IQ 
currently can align, as well as a future state of upcoming integrations and 
when those will go live.
 
I appreciate your help and look forward to making this happen and using 
your platform.

SUBJECT: Pricing Summary

Hey Todd,

Great speaking with you earlier. I wanted to follow up with a clear
overview of our Standard, White Label, and Enterprise plans so you have
everything documented in one place.
------------------------------
*Standard Plan (Grandfathered)*

   -

   *$497/month (forever locked in at this price - Billed quarterly, or
   $749/m)*
   -

   This price is available until our upcoming *V2 platform update*, at
   which point this plan will move to *$997/month*.
   -

   Includes:
   -

      Unlimited data (no caps, no per-record pricing)
      -

      Unlimited queries and daily usage
      -

      Unlimited audiences
      -

      Full access to the platform

To be very clear — this is *not artificial scarcity*. We are currently
priced at a fraction of the market while offering truly unlimited data,
whereas competitors cap records and charge heavily once limits are exceeded.

*Optional Additions*

   -

   *Priority Support:* $297/month
   -

      One-on-one Google Meet support with a team member for live
      troubleshooting
      -

      Even without this, all customers receive strong Slack + email
      support, including voice notes
      -

   *API Access:* $297/month
   -

      Full enterprise-grade API access

------------------------------
*White Label Plan (Grandfathered)*

   -

   *$3,997/month*
   -

   *$115 per additional sub-account*
   -

   Includes:
   -

      Fully white-labeled platform
      -

      Unlimited data across *all* sub-accounts (no shared caps)
      -

      Ability to resell and price however you choose (per record, per
      account, or custom quotes)

Unlike tools such as AudienceLab that charge similar pricing *plus setup
fees* and cap total usage (e.g., 5M records across all accounts), our white
label plan is fully uncapped. In the intent space, a single client can burn
through millions of records in days — or even a single day — which is why
unlimited access is critical.
------------------------------
*Enterprise Plan*

   -

   Starts between *$5,000–$10,000/month*
   -

   Can scale into *multiple six or seven figures annually*, depending on
   use case and capacity
   -

   Includes:
   -

      API access
      -

      Enterprise infrastructure options (clean room, server hosting, HIPAA
      compliance, etc.)

Most teams don’t need this level, but if enterprise-specific requirements
ever apply, we’d do a proper discovery call to scope and quote accurately.
------------------------------
*Key Takeaway*

Both the *Standard* and *White Label* plans are currently grandfathered
with *unlimited data* — no limits on records, queries, or daily volume.
That pricing will increase as the platform continues to evolve, especially
with V2 launching soon.

Happy to walk through this live or answer any questions if you want to dig
deeper.

Best,
Nate

Hey Nate, I tried building some audiences using the SIC and NAICS code for
imaging centers, but when I look at the companies these people work for,
they're schools and other non-related companies. What am I doing wrong?
Also, I know it's unlimited audiences. I see 1000 in the top right and it
keeps getting used up as I create new audiences even with 0 results. Does
that number reset each month?

I'd love a tiny bit of hand holding as I'm getting started so I can be
successful with this software.

Thank you,

Fred L.

Hi Fred, 

Can you share the list you are building? Is it more so static data list of 
imaging centers or is it intent data for some topic filtered by SIC code 
for imaging centers.

Thanks

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this

thank you!

You have a video of the white label? You mentioned you could send one to 
show a potential client and just get rid of your logo.

Hey Josh,

Good question — and I just want to clarify expectations upfront.

We don’t currently have a demo video of the platform with our branding
removed. The reason for that is that the *white-label environment only
exists once you’re actually set up as a white-label partner*.

Once you become a white-label partner, you get:

   -

   Your own fully branded platform (logo, name, colors, domain, etc.)
   -

   A full *admin dashboard*
   -

   Branded *API documentation*
   -

   The ability to create and manage sub-accounts
   -

   Full control over limits (website identification, audiences, usage, etc.)

At that point, *you’d create your own demo videos and sales material* using
*your* branded version of the software, which is what most of our
white-label partners do. That way, everything you show prospects is 100%
native to your brand.

On pricing and reselling:

   -

   You can charge *whatever you want*
   -

   You can create your own pricing tiers
   -

   You can upsell services on top of the software if you choose

We currently see white-label partners selling:

   -

   As low as *$297–$497/month* to smaller or local businesses
   -

   All the way up to *$5,000–$10,000+ per sub-account* for larger or
   enterprise clients

Some partners bundle it into a broader service, others sell it purely as
software — totally up to you.

So in short: there isn’t a pre-made logo-free demo video, but once you’re
white-labeled, you’ll have everything you need to create your own demos and
run sales exactly how you want.

If you have any needed info let us know.

Best,
Nate

Got it. 

Does it look basically the same way as my dashboard looks? If yes, then I 
can just kinda show a demo that way.

Yes, it does. But once white labeled it will have your branding and colors
and logo. Also we are having the biggest update in a year to our platform
and data coming shortly in the next few weeks the release of our V2
Platform. Which is going to allow even more integrations, better

Yes, it does. But once white labeled it will have your branding and colors 
and logo. Also we are having the biggest update in a year to our platform 
and data coming shortly in the next few weeks the release of our V2 
Platform. Which is going to allow even more integrations, better 
email/phone verification, even cleaner interface etc.

SUBJECT: Visitor ID data

Getting some data for the first time!

So it looks like there's no distinction between their personal and work
email?

No LinkedIn URL?

Sometimes we target business only emails instead of personal or vice versa.
Guess that's not an option here?

If there is no LinkedIn URL, i guess we'll have to email enrich using
skiptracing off name and address?

When I do an export off the results page, it's just showing the results and
isn't including the data in See more. Is there a way to get all of it in
one export? Or is that an API thing?

Ok i just checked it off to see what happens.

Sounds like it's best to always have that checked off to get max data?

It’s just b2c don’t care about business info or associated companies. Where 
b2b companies do. So most b2b companies use that toggle and b2c companies 
don’t usually want any of that other data.

*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single

<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

<https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!


Thanks

Hi Wyatt — looping back with the group here.

Following up on the payment link I sent over last week after our call. Once
that’s taken care of, we’ll immediately create your accounts and send over
login credentials so you can get started.

Let me know if you’d like to proceed as outlined, or if anything changed on
your end and we should revisit timing or structure.

Looking forward to getting this live.

Best,
Nate

Thank you for signing up! Below I added some helpful information that can
help get you familiar with the power of our platform.

Login link: app.retargetiq.com/login
User: wyatt@thedwellingcollection.com

*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single
family residential construction companies in the USA* - Watch Video
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393>
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

<https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!


Sincerely,

Alex Ciereszko

I would like to reschedule a video   Want to go over the following details:
Can you pull a list of construction companies looking for leads?
Can you pull a list of real estate investors looking to borrow money for transactional funding?
Can you pull a list of companies looking to outsource their bookkeeping?
Can you put geographically distribution for leads on franchises?


Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks.

SUBJECT: Re: Your Demo with Retarget IQ is Starting Soon

Hi Julian,

I hope you are well! Did you get a chance to watch the intro videos as
examples that Cindy sent over with your log ins? I also added a list of
intent topics here that you can cross reference. to search directly with
any of the topics you had sent me.

Intent Topic List -
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vwSp0SGwpbxPIUBE7CKQ55F3bIQpro3UDSuP3LB93xg/edit?gid=1825796279#gid=1825796279

Video walkthroughs -

*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single
family resident construction companies in the USA* - Watch Video
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393>
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

*Creating Targeted Audiences for Pest Control Marketing 📊* - Watch Video
<https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6>
<https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!




Sincerely,

Alex Ciereszko


Know a business? Refer us for up to $1,000 in recurring commission!

Hey Nate,

How does it work with the direct mail pricing?

Also, the one the other options I was looking at, does provide some
guidance on what's working well for other clients in various spaces.
Much like how you showed me the sales robot and linkedin vs meta ads.
Do you guys have any resources like that?

Thanks again!

Direct mail pricing ranging from 90 cents to $1.15 per piece. That price is
all inclusive, printing, postage and logistics. We also have volume pricing
as well if it comes to that.

We don't have any specific resources like that I don't believe but
everything is pretty straight forward you either use the data for meta,
linkedin outbound, or cold email.

And if you ever need recommendations for specific clients we can help guide
you as well on best practices.


Thanks
Nate

Hey Nate,

Happy Friday!

Funny question, so I'm in the early talks of some deals that would make
Whitelabel a better fit for what I'd be doing with Retarget IQ. It's way
too early for me to make a 2k monthly commitment, but it also would be less
appealing to go after if I have to give up my Grandfathered for life $497
plan.

Can I purcahse the $497 plan now and then have a window of time that if I
bring those deals on board and it make sense for the business, I can still
upgrade up to the Grandfathered Whitelabel for 2k?

Yes. We can guarantee the pricing for 30 days in terms of whitelabel. So
you can signup to $497/m plan and upgrade to the whitelabel plan once it
makes sense for you. Let me know if you want to do the quarterly billing
for the 20% discount or month to month billing by end of day today as our
pricing on Monday is changing.


Thanks

Can I purcahse the $497 plan now and then have a window of time that if I
bring those deals on board and it make sense for the business, I can still
upgrade up to the Grandfathered Whitelabel for 2k?

Yes you can do $497/m plan now. If you want to upgrade to the whitelabel 
next Month for that $2k/m that is fine. We wouldn’t be able to guarantee 
the whitelabel price for more than the next $20

Hey Nate,

Happy Friday!

Funny question, so I'm in the early talks of some deals that would make 
Whitelabel a better fit for what I'd be doing with Retarget IQ. It's way 
too early for me to make a 2k monthly commitment, but it also would be less 
appealing to go after if I have to give up my Grandfathered for life $497 
plan. 

Can I purcahse the $497 plan now and then have a window of time that if I 
bring those deals on board and it make sense for the business, I can still 
upgrade up to the Grandfathered Whitelabel for 2k?

Great thank you Nate!

Also, FYI, I went to setup my account and not sure if you can see, but
there was an issue with the card.

The account has funds,  but tomorrow's  MLK day and National holiday, so I
won't be able to get answers until Tuesday when the bank reopens.

Hopefully, since I submitted payment and this is a card issue, you can hold
things in place for me, while this gets sorted out...

Hey Jackie.

Yes as long as payment is received by Tuesday end of day you will still be
grandfathered-in to that deal. Also we have a 20% discount if you sign up
for quarterly billing vs monthly. So just let me know how you want to
proceed.


Thanks

Thanks Nate!

Talked to the bank, the holiday weekend slowed everything down, so I can
make the payment as soon as the funds are released tomorrow morning. I
assume payment by 9 am tomorrow will be acceptable?

I'm going to do a monthly payment this first time, but as soon as I pick up
more clients I'll switch to quarterly or whitelabel, whichever makes more
sense.

Thanks again for all your help Nate! Excited to finally get started!

Hi Jackie,

Thanks for the update — totally understand, and yes, payment by 9am
tomorrow works fine.

That said, I do want to be transparent on timing. The pricing and terms we
discussed will be honored through *end of day tomorrow*. After that cutoff,
we unfortunately won’t be able to hold this deal anymore. We didn’t extend
this pricing past Friday for anyone else, but we made an exception for you
given the bank delay and didn’t want that to be the reason you missed out.

Starting on the monthly plan is completely fine, and once you’re live and
using the platform, we can easily move you to quarterly, annual, or a
white-label plan at any point if and when that makes more sense or helps
you save.

We’re excited to get you up and running and appreciate you pushing this
through on your end. Let me know if you need anything from me before
tomorrow morning.

Best,
Nate

SUBJECT: Re: Quick question

Hi Cindy & Nate,

Not sure who is the best to direct this too.

I'm wondering about a couple things...

1) Right now you can only choose one intent topic, is that going to change
on the new platform? For the topic areas where there is a really good
fitting topic, it's mostly fine,  but when there isn't a good topic, it's
really restraining. For example, a biological dentist, family dentistry,
implants, crowns are only so helpfully,  ideally we'd be able to also see
who's interested in holistic or alternative medicine, biohacking or
something like that.


2) I am about to speak with a growth leader for a large title company, any
examples of how it's being used for title companies/agents, pricing
examples or ideas?

Any insights for both of these would be appreciated!

Thanks!!!

Yes V2 is suppose to go live Feb 15th which will allow of any custom phrase

SUBJECT: Re: Quick question




How a title company would use it:




1️⃣ Identify Active Buyers & Sellers


Pull people actively researching:



   - “Home buying” 
   - “Refinancing” 
   - “Mortgage rates” 
   - “FSBO” 
   - “Real estate attorney” 
   - “Investment property” 
   - “1031 exchange” 



👉 These aren’t random homeowners — these are people mid-decision.



2️⃣ Identify Realtors & Lenders 

Before

 They Send the Deal


Pull B2B intent for:



   - Real estate brokerages 
   - Mortgage lenders 
   - Loan officers 
   - Investor groups 
   - Property management firms 



Now you’re prospecting people who send deals, not chasing scraps.



3️⃣ Website Visitor De-Anonymization (Huge for Title)




   - Someone visits your “Title Services” or “Escrow” page 
   - RetargetIQ identifies 30–50% of them 
   - You get:
   - Name 
      - Email 
      - Phone 
      - Property data (often) 
   - 
   - You can:
   - Email them 
      - Retarget with Meta/Google 
      - Route to sales instantly 
   - 
   


This is enterprise-grade advantage for a local title shop.



4️⃣ Outreach Stack




   - Cold email to realtors & lenders 
   - Ads to homeowners in escrow-adjacent behavior 
   - CRM sync (HubSpot / Salesforce) 
   - Retargeting ads reinforcing trust + authority 


Pricing could be anywhere from $500/m to $50,000/m depending on the size of 
the company. Most likely around $10,000/m you can charge.


Thanks

Does that intent audience work with google ads?

Or I guess it’s kinda search intent already?

SUBJECT: Re: Payment Link


Yes it can be implemented into Google ads and meta ads. More applicable to 
meta but both work. 

If you are curious how it’s being ultized in these type of ads.

Here output from chat gpt in depth of how this can be implemented.

Below is the same content, unchanged in structure, flow, and guidance — 
with all mentions of DataShopper and AudienceLab removed, leaving 
RetargetIQ as the sole intent data reference.




Below is the practical, non-fluff way high-performing advertisers actually 
use intent data platforms like RetargetIQ 
<chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0> to lower CPC and CPA in Meta Ads and 
Google Ads.


Key mindset shift first:

Intent data does NOT magically lower CPC by itself.

It lowers CPC indirectly by increasing relevance, CTR, conversion rate, and 
post-click match quality, which the ad platforms then reward with cheaper 
traffic.





The Core Concept (What You’re Really Doing)



Intent data lets you:



   1. Pre-qualify traffic 
   2. Tell Meta / Google exactly who converts 
   3. Cut waste from cold, low-intent audiences 
   4. Scale only what proves buying intent 



The platforms don’t “read” your intent data directly — you translate it 
into signals they understand.





How Intent Data Actually Lowers CPC / CPA




The 4 Levers That Matter


Lever

Why It Drops Costs

Higher CTR

Better relevance score → cheaper clicks

Higher CVR

Algorithm learns faster

Better seed audiences

Lookalikes outperform cold

Excluded junk traffic

Less wasted spend





METHOD 1: High-Intent Retargeting (Fastest ROI)



This is where 80% of cost reduction happens.



What Intent Tools Give You




   - Website visitors (even anonymous) 
   - In-market signals (searches, category interest) 
   - Business / consumer attributes 
   - Time-based intent (last 7–30 days) 




How to Use It in 

Meta Ads



Step-by-step:



   1. Use RetargetIQ to identify visitors 
   2. Sync them to:
   - Meta Custom Audiences 
      - Email-based Custom Audiences 
      - Pixel-based retargeting pools 
   3. 
   4. Run:
   - MOF ads (proof, testimonials) 
      - BOF ads (offers, demos, pricing) 
   5. 
   


Result:



   - 2–5x CTR 
   - 30–60% lower CPA than cold traffic 



Meta LOVES retargeting because the user already showed intent.





METHOD 2: Intent-Seeded Lookalike Audiences (Scale Cheap)




This Is the Cheat Code



Instead of:



   - Website visitors 
   - Purchasers 
   - Random leads 



You seed lookalikes with:



   - Verified intent users 
   - High-value buyers 
   - Recently in-market users 




How to Do It




   1. Export high-intent users 
   2. Upload as:
   - Meta Custom Audience 
      - Google Customer Match 
   3. 
   4. Create:
   - 1% lookalike (highest quality) 
      - Then 2–5% for scale 
   5. 
   



Why CPC Drops




   - Better match quality 
   - Faster learning phase 
   - Higher engagement signals 






METHOD 3: Google Ads — Layer Intent Into Search & YouTube




Google Search (Extremely Powerful)



Use intent audiences as:



   - Bid modifiers 
   - Observation layers 
   - Exclusions 



Example:


+40% bid for users with:




   - Recent intent 
   - Past site visit 
   - Matching firmographic data 



You’re not paying more blindly — you’re paying more only for buyers.





YouTube Ads (Underrated)




   - Upload intent lists 
   - Run education + authority content 
   - Retarget viewers with search or display 



This warms traffic before they ever click search ads.





METHOD 4: Exclusion = Hidden Cost Killer



Most advertisers forget this.



What to Exclude




   - Non-buyer intent categories 
   - Job seekers 
   - Competitors 
   - Students / research traffic 
   - Low-income or irrelevant firmographics 



Result:

Same budget → fewer junk impressions → higher efficiency → cheaper CPA.





METHOD 5: Message Match (Why Intent Makes Ads Cheaper)



Intent data lets you change the ad copy.


Instead of:


“Book a demo”


You say:


“Comparing platforms? See why teams switch in 7 days.”


Relevance ↑

CTR ↑

CPC ↓





Platform-Specific Summary




Meta Ads



✔ Retarget high-intent users

✔ Seed lookalikes with intent

✔ Exclude low-quality segments

✔ Improve relevance score



Google Ads



✔ Bid higher only on intent users

✔ Use Customer Match

✔ Layer into YouTube → Search

✔ Cut wasted impressions





Reality Check (Important)



Intent data will not:



   - Fix a bad offer 
   - Fix bad creatives 
   - Fix poor landing pages 



But when everything else is solid:


It’s one of the biggest CPA-crushing advantages available.

I've attached a few video links below as well for you.

*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!

Great thanks!

I'll see how the ID resolution data goes over the next couple of days and

B2B Intent topics list:

B2c:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H61t44XPo99-KuhaSEj2HiJ93DFEvJC3/view?usp=sharing

Score category is for intent data. There are 3 classifications. low, Medium
and High

Try putting life coach in ai search and see what it comes back with.
Looking to pull B2b Static, B2b intent or b2c intent?

Hey Nate,

you basically create an intent audience. Then go to all audiences click preview and click download all and name the file. Then go to saved queries in the dropdown and schedule it to run daily or at whatever interval you want. Then daily whenever you want fresh data you just login and download the file and manually upload it to a Facebook custom audience.

Ccing in Cindy to help with additional support if needed so please reply all to threads.


Thanks

Thank you Nate.

So far, Identification hasn't been close unfortunately - I have tested
across multiple devices and browsers across multiple sites and users.  It
is very far off.

Pixel happens.

Anyways - Audience data, I tried to create some audiences that just pulled
whole companies, of places I know names etc.  All came up 0 records.

I was able to successfully make an audience for dental imaging and life
insurance.  The dental imaging intent showed medium high, but interesting
pull on companies etc.

Before we ask more tech heavy questions - can more than one topic be
selected at the same time - meaning, insurance.  I want to see IUL, Term,
Perm Whole.  Instead I have to select one at a time.  Same for Dental - If
I want to find people that may need/want an x-ray sensor.  I would like to
pull Dental Supplies and Dental X-ray Software together.

Apologies for the late reply just wrapped up calls. Ya unfortunately you’ll 
need to do single interest topic per pull. 

There will be an update coming where you can do multiple in the future. 
Also all emails will be verified also upon release of V2 of the platform. 
Also the website identification pixel will be improving as well via the big 
update. 


I will CC Cindy in here as well to be able to help with any support 
questions you may have.


Thanks
Nate

SUBJECT: Pricing Overview + Next Steps

Hi Charles,

Great connecting earlier. I wanted to follow up and clearly outline pricing
and plan details so you have everything in one place.
Core Platform Pricing

   -

   *$497/month* — Unlimited usage across the platform
   -

   Includes *5 SuperPixels* (each covers an entire website)
   -

   *Additional SuperPixels:* $10/month each
   -

      With volume, this pricing can be reduced

Add-Ons

   -

   *Priority Support:* $297/month
   -

      One-on-one support calls with a member of our team
      -

      Not a group call (unlike AudienceLab)
      -

   *Enterprise API Access:* $297/month
   -

      Full access to our API for enrichment, data pulls, automation, etc.

White-Label Plan

   -

   *$2,997.99/month*
   -

   Includes *up to 10 seats*
   -

   *Additional seats:* $100/month per seat
   -

   *No record caps at all*

Why This Matters

Even on AudienceLab’s highest tier, record caps still apply. With
Columbus-style intent data, it’s easy to burn through millions of records
in a single day—especially when running across multiple clients. Without
separate accounts per client, those caps become a real bottleneck. Our
platform has *no record limits*, even at scale.
------------------------------

I’ll also send over:

   -

   A full list of

*intent topics
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jRDeZ6yfkvxp9c-407_zG1FpoabIdXP7n5pX3w6YJTc/edit?usp=sharing
   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jRDeZ6yfkvxp9c-407_zG1FpoabIdXP7n5pX3w6YJTc/edit?usp=sharing>*
   -

   Our

*API documentation https://docs.retargetiq.com/docs/getting-started
   <https://docs.retargetiq.com/docs/getting-started>*
   -

   And I’ll follow up once I hear back from the tech team regarding the
   custom audience we submitted

Great questions.

Everything is correct. Except our whitelabel plan is separate from our 
$497/m plan. But yes right now the $497/m grandfathered in plan is 
unlimited everything. Only additional cost is if you need api access which 
id an additional $297/m.

I will CC two of our reps Alex and Nate in that can answer any other 
questions you may have.


Thanks

Hello, 

I came across one of your ads comparing your service to Audience Lab. 

If it's basically the same service (which it looks like it is), but with 
more features (unlimited audience creation, unlimited ID resolution, white 
label included) - I believe I saw that for $497/month.

Is that accurate?

If so, I won't need to book a Demo, I'd probably just like to sign up so if 
you could send me more information on how to go about that, I 
would appreciate it. Thank you.

Alex, nice to chat with you today. Send me over that payment / access link

One more question -

About the data enrichment... if someone wants to enrich data with a name
and physical address, are you able to provide accurate email and phone?
If so, about how accurate is it?

Thank you!

No worries. Have a safe flight.

Our standard plan is different from our whitelabel and enterprise plan. But 
the standard plan we are talking about is unlimited everything.

Thanks

Got it, thanks. 

Can you send me info on the white label and enterprise plan so I can 
evaluate which one will be best for me?

Hey Josh,

Great speaking with you earlier. I wanted to follow up with a clear
overview of our Standard, White Label, and Enterprise plans so you have
everything documented in one place.
------------------------------
*Standard Plan (Grandfathered)*

   -

   *$497/month (forever locked in at this price)*
   -

   This price is available until our upcoming *V2 platform update*, at
   which point this plan will move to *$997/month*.
   -

   Includes:
   -

      Unlimited data (no caps, no per-record pricing)
      -

      Unlimited queries and daily usage
      -

      Unlimited audiences
      -

      Full access to the platform

To be very clear — this is *not artificial scarcity*. We are currently
priced at a fraction of the market while offering truly unlimited data,
whereas competitors cap records and charge heavily once limits are exceeded.

*Optional Additions*

   -

   *Priority Support:* $297/month
   -

      One-on-one Google Meet support with a team member for live
      troubleshooting
      -

      Even without this, all customers receive strong Slack + email
      support, including voice notes
      -

   *API Access:* $297/month
   -

      Full enterprise-grade API access

------------------------------
*White Label Plan (Grandfathered)*

   -

   *$2,997/month*
   -

   *$115 per additional sub-account*
   -

   Includes:
   -

      Fully white-labeled platform
      -

      Unlimited data across *all* sub-accounts (no shared caps)
      -

      Ability to resell and price however you choose (per record, per
      account, or custom quotes)

Unlike tools such as AudienceLab that charge similar pricing *plus setup
fees* and cap total usage (e.g., 5M records across all accounts), our white
label plan is fully uncapped. In the intent space, a single client can burn
through millions of records in days — or even a single day — which is why
unlimited access is critical.
------------------------------
*Enterprise Plan*

   -

   Starts between *$5,000–$10,000/month*
   -

   Can scale into *multiple six or seven figures annually*, depending on
   use case and capacity
   -

   Includes:
   -

      API access
      -

      Enterprise infrastructure options (clean room, server hosting, HIPAA
      compliance, etc.)

Most teams don’t need this level, but if enterprise-specific requirements
ever apply, we’d do a proper discovery call to scope and quote accurately.
------------------------------
*Key Takeaway*

Both the *Standard* and *White Label* plans are currently grandfathered
with *unlimited data* — no limits on records, queries, or daily volume.
That pricing will increase as the platform continues to evolve, especially
with V2 launching soon.

Happy to walk through this live or answer any questions if you want to dig
deeper.

Best,
Nate

Alright awesome. 

I think I’ll start with the unlimited 497/month to start. But likely will 
want to upgrade to white label within the next few weeks.

Last question about the lists. What data points do you get? Is it the same 
as audience lab like names, verified emails/numbers, addresses, encrypted 
emails to use for lookalike audiences for ads, business info, etc. 

As for the white label. Do you happen to have a video that’s unbranded to 
show potential clients? I have a current client that was asking about their 
own dashboard and is willing to pay more for access to a dashboard of their 
own, but wants a demo. 

Thanks,
Josh

Yes you are able to find that. Intent Data yes both B2C and B2B intent
data. 40,000+ topics. Also get website identification. Data points are
almost identical to audience lab. For whitelabel we don't have an unbranded
one. Usually once clients start whitelabeling they make their own video
with their branded platform. Our UI is very user friendly and clean tho. So
you could always just take screenshots and remove our branding to share
with prospects.

Signup Link for the Standard Grandfathered in plan:

Let me know once you take care of this and we will shoot over your login

Hey Nate,

Yes you are able to find that. Intent Data yes both B2C and B2B intent 
data. 40,000+ topics. Also get website identification. Data points are 
almost identical to audience lab. For whitelabel we don't have an unbranded 
one. Usually once clients start whitelabeling they make their own video 
with their branded platform. Our UI is very user friendly and clean tho. So 
you could always just take screenshots and remove our branding to share 
with prospects.

Signup Link for the Standard Grandfathered in plan: 
https://buy.stripe.com/3cI28sdaYfG6c9q6iR4gg05

Let me know once you take care of this and we will shoot over your login 
credentials.


Thanks

Right now I need to build the following list:

B2C: bathroom remodels in Waltham, Newton, Lexington MA. 

B2B:
- chiropractors
- integrative practitioners
- functional medical centers
- wellness centers
- TRT. Professionals

How would I go about creating these lists?

Thanks

SUBJECT: Re: Getting started

Thank you. I tried doing the B2C searching for ""Bathroom Remodeling"" and then I added rules for 15 cities that I needed in MA. It just completes and there's 0 records. Did I do something wrong or? I went back on the dates for the last 5 days. I've done this before when I was using audience lab and I'd usually get records of like 1,000-2,000 records. Just let me know if there's something I did wrong or anything else I need to do.

SUBJECT: Re: Getting started

Yes it should not be showing 0 records. Please try using zip codes. Ask
Chat GPT to give you an excel sheet with every zip code in your service
area and instead of filtering by city filter by ZIP code. You can upload a
CSV excel file with all the zip codes in it (1 zipcode per cell, all in
column 1 going down 1 zip code in each row).

This will let you pull the list accurately and correctly.


Thanks

Alright awesome, I'll give that a shot. I have a demo scheduled for Thursday, but trying to get some list out to clients before then. Sorry about all the questions. I also didn't notice a place to enrich the data, where is that located?

Ask Chat GPT to give you an excel sheet with every zip code in your service area and instead of filtering by city filter by ZIP code. You can upload a CSV excel file with all the zip codes in it (1 zipcode per cell, all in column 1 going down 1 zip code in each row). This will let you pull the list accurately and correctly.

Thanks, Josh Sent from my iPhone On Jan 12, 2026, at 9:38 PM, Nate Calhoun < nate@retargetiq.com > wrote: Hey Josh, Great speaking with you earlier. I wanted to follow up with a clear overview of our Standard, White Label, and Enterprise plans so you have everything documented in one place. Standard Plan (Grandfathered) $497/month (forever locked in at this price) This price is available until our upcoming V2 platform update , at which point this plan will move to $997/month . Includes: Unlimited data (no caps, no per-record pricing) Unlimited queries and daily usage Unlimited audiences Full access to the platform To be very clear — this is not artificial scarcity . We are currently priced at a fraction of the market while offering truly unlimited data, whereas competitors cap records and charge heavily once limits are exceeded. Optional Additions Priority Support: $297/month One-on-one Google Meet support with a team member for live troubleshooting Even without this, all customers receive strong Slack + email support, including voice notes API Access: $297/month Full enterprise-grade API access White Label Plan (Grandfathered) $2,997/month $115 per additional sub-account Includes: Fully white-labeled platform Unlimited data across all sub-accounts (no shared caps) Ability to resell and price however you choose (per record, per account, or custom quotes) Unlike tools such as AudienceLab that charge similar pricing plus setup fees and cap total usage (e.g., 5M records across all accounts), our white label plan is fully uncapped. In the intent space, a single client can burn through millions of records in days — or even a single day — which is why unlimited access is critical. Enterprise Plan Starts between $5,000–$10,000/month Can scale into multiple six or seven figures annually , depending on use case and capacity Includes: API access Enterprise infrastructure options (clean room, server hosting, HIPAA compliance, etc.) Most teams don’t need this level, but if enterprise-specific requirements ever apply, we’d do a proper discovery call to scope and quote accurately. Key Takeaway Both the Standard and White Label plans are currently grandfathered with unlimited data — no limits on records, queries, or daily volume. That pricing will increase as the platform continues to evolve, especially with V2 launching soon. Happy to walk through this live or answer any questions if you want to dig deeper.

Enrichment is done manually by sending us the list usually takes 48 hours.
Or can be done basically instantly thru Api.


No worries

Hey Nate,
Shaun and I are speaking again soon. I did remember one thing that I forgot
to ask about - lead enrichment from our CRM (GoHighLevel) are we able to
get full enrichment data of contacts that hit our system from a form.
They have given us their name, email, and phone number in almost all cases.
We'd want to enrich that data as much as possible. See if there is a
business they are connected to all of that data as well as any demographic
data you'd have.

Regards, Brad

Hey Brad,

Yes we can definitely enrich that data from GoHighLevel forms. We can pull
in business info, demographics, and whatever else we have available for
those contacts. But api setup and api usage required to do this. But once
setup really needs no maintenance.



thanks

Nate

Hey Nate,
We will move forward with the main platform (no API for now) on a
month-to-month basis to ensure it meets our needs and to lock in the price.
What do you need from us to get started?

Hi Brad!

Thank you for signing up! Below I added some helpful information that can
help get you familiar with the power of our platform.

Login link: app.retargetiq.com/login
User: brad@pixellocal.com
Pass: BradRocks123


*Walkthrough of Pulling Decision makers with a business email at single
family resident construction companies in the USA* - Watch Video
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393>
<https://www.loom.com/share/e95498633a014c6982e5ab95f68d0393?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walk you through the process of building a B2B static list
specifically for construction companies, targeting decision-makers like
CEOs and VPs. I demonstrate how to filter by business email validation and
industry specifics to ensure we pull accurate data, ultimately generating a
list of around 11,000 records. I also emphasize the importance of cleaning
the data before any cold emailing efforts. Please make sure to utilize the
S.I.C. codes effectively and download the final list for your outreach
campaigns. Let me know if you have any questions as you work through this
process!

<https://www.loom.com/share/2ec17f0022a34d0c998ce21e6a3c47e6?utm_medium=gif>

In this video, I walked you through the process of creating an audience for
pest control inquiries from October 19th to 20th, which resulted in 125,000
records. I demonstrated how to download either the top 500 records or the
entire dataset. I also mentioned that the system will need a little time to
process the request before you can download the results. Please make sure
to check the saved queries for updates on your downloads. Let me know if
you have any questions!


Thanks,

Cindy

Thanks for sending that over - during the onboarding process, I didn't
realize I was signing up for the first pixel by listing that website. Can
you delete that one for me (PixelSystems.io) that is one of our sites but
is the wrong campaign for the first pixel that we want to deploy.

Sorry to already be that customer.  🤦🏼‍♂️

Ya so it is discounted. The monthly rate is $797/m so by doing quarterly is 
it discounted to roughly $500/m. Which equates to 37% discount. We also 
have annual plan for $5000/years which is discounted even further.


Thanks

Hey Daryl,

Totally get it. Unfortunately we can't do that as other prospects were told
that Friday is the cut off and we have to be fair too everyone. But even if
you sign up next week the pricing will still be $497/m but will require
quarterly billing (every 3 months) and if you want to do month to month
billing that's fine as well. That will be at $747/m if you want to do month
to month billing starting next week. But as mentioned before we will honor
the $497/m plan month to month until end of day today.


Thanks
Nate


Thanks

Thanks

Nate

That's pretty unfortunate. As I told you, I wanted to test your database to
see if it was any better than audience Lab. Pearl diver visual visitor.
And now it looks like it's going to cost me $1,500 just to test it.   And
I'll still need another vendor for the site pixels.

Hello Nate & Alex,It was a pleasure to meet you yesterday. Looking forward to
collaborating and growing together. You are building an amazing product.
I have attached a quick reference for mTap Enrichment.
Can you please share with me the document that lists down all the fields that
you pull as a part of the enrichment process along with all the intent signals
that you have.
In the next few days ( before 22nd), I would like to hash out our collaboration
process and pricing so that we can start working on implementation from 23rd.
I have included Dilip and Vikas, the two lead architects of mTap.
Looking forward to hearing from you.

API Documentation can be seen here. Will also get you the custom endpoints
not listed on here for things such as waterfall enrichment.

I have Wednesday at 4pm PST Alex does that work with you also?

If not, Thursday will work. Last week and this week are extremely packed
with calls. So let's try to get something on the calendar ASAP.

API Documentation can be seen here. Will also get you the custom endpoints not
listed on here for things such as waterfall enrichment.

I have Wednesday at 4pm PST Alex does that work with you also?

If not, Thursday will work. Last week and this week are extremely packed with
calls. So let's try to get something on the calendar ASAP.

ThanksNate

Hello Nate & Alex,It was a pleasure to meet you yesterday. Looking forward to

I have attached a quick reference for mTap Enrichment.
Can you please share with me the document that lists down all the fields that
you pull as a part of the enrichment process along with all the intent signals

In the next few days ( before 22nd), I would like to hash out our collaboration

I have included Dilip and Vikas, the two lead architects of mTap.

The website field should be the slug of the website that could be found in 
the dashboard. They’ve entered the website url, that's why getting ‘invalid

Hello Nate,I pulled in the information using email for me. The question is, that
your response does not tell me any of the professional information. I did get to
know a lot of my personal info which was scary!
Do you not provide any work related information? like my linkedin profile and
the companies I had worked for? ​​

Hello Nate,I tried to pull a couple of them. Most of them were returned null. I
was able to get my data for rgupta@hurekatek.com but without the Companies
array. Do look into it rgupta@hurekatek.com
Also an example of no data. bmcgivern@wendell.com ( FYI I got the info from Clay
and others)

If they are Null there is no record.

Hi Seth.

Have you had a demo with our team yet? We don’t offer a free trial per se but we will show it to you on a demo screen share and can pull lists you want live on the call to show you our tools ability.

We are less than 1/5 the price of audience lab and have people daily signing up from audience lab and pearl diver.

I’ll CC two of our account managers to setup a demo with you.

Thanks

Hi Seth.

Are you free for a demo this week? Our pricing is doubling shortly from $497/m to $997/m when our V2 interface comes out shortly. We are slammed currently with calls I believe our first available is Wednesday or Thursday this week.

If you want to get on the schedule let me know and we can pull some sample list live on the demo with you.


Thanks
Nate Calhoun

Yes, let's schedule a time to chat. Would love to test some audiences asap,
as our CPA has risen significantly recently.

Hey Nate, a few things real quick.

Where are the loom training videos that you mentioned?

Also is this intent data only the US or is it in other countries as well?

Lastly within the Audience Builder, it only allows me to select one keyword
phrase, I'm not able to do multiple keyword phrases. Is that correct?

I will have to get our support to send those videos I can’t find them in my 
Google Drive.

Everything is US. Will have Canada and Europe hopefully Q2 just a lot of 
data legality that’s holding that up.

Yes one topic at a time

SUBJECT: RetargetIQ Pricing & Next Steps

Hey Josh,

Great speaking with you earlier today — wanted to quickly recap RetargetIQ
pricing and next steps so you have everything in one place.

*RetargetIQ Pricing Overview*

• *$497/month (Grandfathered Plan)*
Includes *1 SuperPixel for 1 website*
– Covers every page on the entire site
– *Unlimited records* (no caps — pull hundreds of millions per month if
needed)
– B2B + B2C data, intent data, enrichment, and more
– Flat-rate pricing, no per-record fees

• *Additional SuperPixels (Optional)*
– $149/month per additional website

• *Priority Support (Optional)*
– $297/month
– One-on-one support with a real human on our team
– Not group calls or office hours (unlike AudienceLab)

• *API Access (Optional)*
– $297/month
– Full enterprise-level API access (enrichment, data pulls, automations,
etc.)

I’ll also include a link to the *full API documentation* so you can see
exactly what’s possible via API.

https://docs.retargetiq.com/docs/getting-started

*Important Note on Pricing*
The *$497/month plan is a grandfathered offer* and will be going away soon.
We can only guarantee this pricing *until Tuesday at 5:00 PM Pacific*.

I’ll include:
– The *Stripe payment link* to get started
– The *API documentation link* for review

Payment Link: https://buy.stripe.com/3cI28sdaYfG6c9q6iR4gg05

Let me know if you have any questions or want to walk through anything
together — happy to jump on a quick 1:1 if helpful.

Best,
Nate Calhoun

Unfortunately we are no longer offering this grandfathered plan. If you
decide to stop for a while and come back please just expect that the price
will be the current price ($997/m) or more and may not include unlimited
data as all similar tools on the market are $2,000+ a month.

No worries. Where did you send communication of the cancellation and where
did we confirm it? I don't see anything on my end. Maybe it was another
team member, Can you send over that communication and I'll send a refund.
No worries.


Thanks

Hey Anton,

Yes you have full control to charge however you like. Data is unlimited on
your end but you have freedom to charge per record or set audience list
pull caps or anything for any client.

Whitelabel pricing is $3000/m and includes 10 seats and each additional
seat is $100.

Thanks
Nate

 Hey Nate - sorry got delayed on this.

Quick question on the super pixel website identifier.  Got a question about
compliance when talking with a client. Are the visitors seeing  a pop up to
opt in or opting out like the things you see on sites now - or is it just
running in background and resolving passively?

It is 100% legal and compliance. All data is opt in data. But no they don’t 
see a pop up to opt in or out. That is not necessary for legality or 
compliance.

Let me know if this answered your question.

I was thinking it wasn’t the pop-up that says allow cookies or opt out, I 
was thinking you an audience lab and pearl diver had all said it was more 
private. It didn’t pop up, but you still got the information. It’s a 
medical industry business so they had the question about the compliance of 
how can you get customers or visitors information without their permission 
and it be legal. Sorry this is voice texting so hope everything came 
through OK.

Also have another client will be using this for that is being pitched 
adroll. Are you familiar with them and they’re offerings or are they a 
completely different type of service than you guys?

info it’s all 100% legal and compliant.

Sure thing. Also appreciate you not harassing me. The audience lab guy got 
crazy with emails and text like “why are you ghosting me?“ And saying it 
was rude in this and that because I told him I wanted to wait to make sure 
of what we wanted to do. Very unprofessional.

It is 100% legal and compliance. All data is opt in data. But no they don’t 
see a pop up to opt in or out. That is not necessary for legality or

Let me know if this answered your question.

Hey Nate - sorry got delayed on this. 

Quick question on the super pixel website identifier.  Got a question about 
compliance when talking with a client. Are the visitors seeing  a pop up to 
opt in or opting out like the things you see on sites now - or is it just 
running in background and resolving passively?

Hey Marshall — totally understand, and no worries at all.

Feel free to take your time, and definitely don’t hesitate to ask if any 
questions come up. Happy to walk through anything in more detail or jump on 
another demo if that’s helpful.

And just to add a bit of context on what you mentioned — we’ve seen the 
AudienceLab situation as well. They’ve been sending out emails to their 
list and even running ads that are pretty clearly targeted at us, including 
some statements that are flat-out inaccurate. We’ve made a conscious 
decision not to engage or respond publicly, because it doesn’t really move 
the needle for customers and usually just creates more noise.

What’s been interesting, though, is that despite all of that, we’ve had a 
steady flow of teams switching over from AudienceLab after testing the 
platform and realizing it’s a much better fit for what they’re trying to 
do. So we’re just staying focused on execution and product.

We’ve also got a major V2 release coming out around mid-February that’s 
going to significantly expand what the platform can do, so things are only 
going to accelerate from here.

No rush on our end at all — just let me know if there’s anything you’d like 
us to clarify, or if you want to hop on another call to walk through 
anything in more detail.

Best,  
Nate

Ritas,

Appreciate your time today. Let me know if you are leaning more towards
wanting to resell/whitelabel our platform or use it for your roofing
company first.

We can go over best practices. Our price is increasing from $497/m to
$997/m shortly (not fake scarcity). Our company and Audience Lab are the
two biggest/most well known ones on the market. A lot of other companies
are white labeling our platform or theirs. Audience Lab's starting price is
$2597/m + a one time activation fee of $500 so our pricing is less than 20%
of their rate and there is a data cap on all their plans.

We have no data caps or hidden fees.

We can guarantee the grandfathered price till the end of day Friday so if
you decide you want to utilize our platform let us know by Friday.

Website visitor for now. We are working on adding audiences next to api. 
But the audiences you can schedule and just login and download them in 30 
seconds daily without having to rebuild the query.

Thanks

Nate,

I had a question on the feeds that exists currently.  I see in my saved audiences I can send to an ad account, what data is sent to the webhook? Is it just email in both the meta and google example?

We no longer are offering that grandfathered-in deal for unlimited 
everything for $497/m since our intent data lead scoring came out. But I’ll 
honor it since we talked before that came out and I know Christmas time is 
busy for everyone.

Here is the payment link:

Stripe Checkout <https://buy.stripe.com/3cI28sdaYfG6c9q6iR4gg05>
buy.stripe.com <https://buy.stripe.com/3cI28sdaYfG6c9q6iR4gg05>
<https://buy.stripe.com/3cI28sdaYfG6c9q6iR4gg05> 
<https://buy.stripe.com/3cI28sdaYfG6c9q6iR4gg05>

Let me know once you take care of this invoice. And I’ll send over your 
login credentials.


Happy Holidays,

Nate Calhoun

Hi Nate,

I did see the link to join Retarget. Is it still available for the 
497/month.

Cheers,

SUBJECT: RE: Your meeting recap - Roderick Brown Intro Call

Hi Alex and Nate –

We are having an issue with the visitor identification adding it to the site global headers. The current tool within Retarget shows that there are users but nothing else. It is not showing the page they are on, where the traffic is coming from or information on the user, etc etc.

Can you confirm the system is set up to pull user data?

Cheers,
Rod

Hey Roderick,

We no longer are offering that grandfathered-in deal for unlimited everything for $497/m since our intent data lead scoring came out. But I’ll honor it since we talked before that came out and I know Christmas time is busy for everyone.

Here is the payment link:

Hi Alex and Nate –

We are having an issue with the visitor identification adding it to the site global headers. The current tool within Retarget shows that there are users but nothing else. It is not showing the page they are on, where the traffic is coming from or information on the user, etc etc.

Can you confirm the system is set up to pull user data?

Hey Matt,

Just wanted to circle back and see if you were wanting to still take advantage of the $497/m unlimited grandfathered-in plan. 

Just had our intent data scoring come out so our prices increased as of today. But as mentioned on our call we can honor the $497/m grandfathered in price until the end of week.

Thanks
Nate

Hey Guys,

Just wanted to get back to you and let you know the probate intent search is available under the b2b intent data search. Already have car accident and the others you mentioned on the call.

Let me know if there is anything else. 

We can honor the $497/m price point until Friday EOD even tho our intent data scoring ranking came out today. 


Thanks
Nate.

probate lawyer under B2B is not what we need.  Lawyers sell to consumers.
Is that available?  Show us that and we can do something.

The tech team looked into this intent signal.

This is exactly what they said.

“Description: The term probate refers to a legal process in which the 
validity and authenticity of a will are determined.

Topic name: Probate

Topic ID: 4377”

I believe this is suppose to be under b2c not b2b. Team is doing a deep 
dive into this since I don’t believe b2b probate is a thing. 

Have a great weekend. Just wanted to update you.


Thanks
Nate

SUBJECT: Re: API KEY

Nate, thanks again for the help last week.

Can I pay for 2-3 hours of paid support to help get three workflows set up correctly? I mainly want to make sure the RetargetIQ pieces are wired properly, I can do everything else.

What I’m looking to implement:

  *   Campaign 1 - Capture all homepage visitors (webhook)

     *   Validate webhook data flowing into n8n so I can reliably add contacts to marketing sequences

  *   Campaign 2 - Visitor with business email, LinkedIn URL, and mobile phone, then push to Google Sheets

     *   Only want records with a business email + LinkedIn + mobile number

  *   Campaign 3 - Pull Direct Mail intent lists daily

     *   Set up an automated weekly audience pull

     *   Ideally via API, so the list can flow directly into a marketing automation

     *
Did a test today but manually (12/15-19 direct mail)

  *
Campaign 4 - Validate what I am doing to use the API to enrich emails, already have a flow built in N8n.

Thanks guys, here is the updated help / needs.

  *
Campaign 1 - Solved
  *   Campaign 2 - Solved

  *   Campaign 3 - Still need help see below

     *
Pull Direct Mail intent lists weekly and import
     *   Set up an automated weekly audience pull

        *   Ideally via API, so the list can flow directly into a marketing automation

Did a test last week but manually (12/15-19 direct mail)

  *   Campaign 4 - Still need help see below

     *
Validate what I am doing to use the API to enrich emails, already have a flow built in N8n.

Nate, thanks again for the help last week.

Can I pay for 2-3 hours of paid support to help get three workflows set up correctly? I mainly want to make sure the RetargetIQ pieces are wired properly, I can do everything else.

What I’m looking to implement:

  *   Campaign 1 - Capture all homepage visitors (webhook)

     *   Validate webhook data flowing into n8n so I can reliably add contacts to marketing sequences

  *   Campaign 2 - Visitor with business email, LinkedIn URL, and mobile phone, then push to Google Sheets

Hey Rick,

Just waiting for our tech team to get me the answers unfortunately I don’t know all the intricacies regarding all the in depth API stuff.

For campaign 3 waiting to hear back how can do thru api and checking to see if it’s possible.

Campaign 4 enrichment thru API I know is possible as we have lots of people doing that. So just need to get the correct api endpoint for you. It should be in the api documentation. As stated couple emails back the endpoints on our api documentation are correct the root domain is just incorrect.


Thanks
Nate 

Trying to get an answer for you asap.

Just heard back from one of our engineers.

This is what he said
1. You can schedule the audience on one week duration from UI. Right now, we don't have API for that.
2. In the response, there would be a company object and you can find the business email and linkedin url in that object if that user has any.

Does this help answer your question. 

Thanks

Nate, thanks again for the help last week.

Can I pay for 2-3 hours of paid support to help get three workflows set up correctly? I mainly want to make sure the RetargetIQ pieces are wired properly, I can do everything else.

What I’m looking to implement:

  *   Campaign 1 - Capture all homepage visitors (webhook)

     *   Validate webhook data flowing into n8n so I can reliably add contacts to marketing sequences

  *   Campaign 2 - Visitor with business email, LinkedIn URL, and mobile phone, then push to Google Sheets

     *   Only want records with a business email + LinkedIn + mobile number

  *   Campaign 3 - Pull Direct Mail intent lists daily

     *   Set up an automated weekly audience pull

     *   Ideally via API, so the list can flow directly into a marketing automation

     *
Did a test today but manually (12/15-19 direct mail)

  *
Campaign 4 - Validate what I am doing to use the API to enrich emails, already have a flow built in N8n.

Just heard back from one of our engineers.

This is what he said
1. You can schedule the audience on one week duration from UI. Right now, we don't have API for that.
2. In the response, there would be a company object and you can find the business email and linkedin url in that object if that user has any.

Does this help answer your question.

okay and what data are you enriching from. Do you have their website, first name, last name? Which fields do you already have. I know you want to enrich the data to find their email.

Just heard back from one of our engineers.

This is what he said
1. You can schedule the audience on one week duration from UI. Right now, we don't have API for that.
2. In the response, there would be a company object and you can find the business email and linkedin url in that object if that user has any.

Does this help answer your question.

Thanks

Hey Rick,

Just waiting for our tech team to get me the answers unfortunately I don’t know all the intricacies regarding all the in depth API stuff.

For campaign 3 waiting to hear back how can do thru api and checking to see if it’s possible.

Campaign 4 enrichment thru API I know is possible as we have lots of people doing that. So just need to get the correct api endpoint for you. It should be in the api documentation. As stated couple emails back the endpoints on our api documentation are correct the root domain is just incorrect.


Thanks

Nate, thanks again for the help last week.

Can I pay for 2-3 hours of paid support to help get three workflows set up correctly? I mainly want to make sure the RetargetIQ pieces are wired properly, I can do everything else.

What I’m looking to implement:

  *   Campaign 1 - Capture all homepage visitors (webhook)

     *   Validate webhook data flowing into n8n so I can reliably add contacts to marketing sequences

  *   Campaign 2 - Visitor with business email, LinkedIn URL, and mobile phone, then push to Google Sheets

     *   Only want records with a business email + LinkedIn + mobile number

  *   Campaign 3 - Pull Direct Mail intent lists daily

     *   Set up an automated weekly audience pull

     *   Ideally via API, so the list can flow directly into a marketing automation

     *
Did a test today but manually (12/15-19 direct mail)

  *
Campaign 4 - Validate what I am doing to use the API to enrich emails, already have a flow built in N8n.

Just heard back from one of our engineers.

This is what he said
1. You can schedule the audience on one week duration from UI. Right now, we don't have API for that.
2. In the response, there would be a company object and you can find the business email and linkedin url in that object if that user has any.

Does this help answer your question.

Thanks

Hey Rick,

Just waiting for our tech team to get me the answers unfortunately I don’t know all the intricacies regarding all the in depth API stuff.

For campaign 3 waiting to hear back how can do thru api and checking to see if it’s possible.

Campaign 4 enrichment thru API I know is possible as we have lots of people doing that. So just need to get the correct api endpoint for you. It should be in the api documentation. As stated couple emails back the endpoints on our api documentation are correct the root domain is just incorrect.


Thanks
Nate

Trying to get an answer for you asap.

Nate, thanks again for the help last week.

Can I pay for 2-3 hours of paid support to help get three workflows set up correctly? I mainly want to make sure the RetargetIQ pieces are wired properly, I can do everything else.

What I’m looking to implement:

  *   Campaign 1 - Capture all homepage visitors (webhook)

     *   Validate webhook data flowing into n8n so I can reliably add contacts to marketing sequences

  *   Campaign 2 - Visitor with business email, LinkedIn URL, and mobile phone, then push to Google Sheets

SUBJECT: Recap of Our Call + RetargetIQ Overview & Grandfathered Pricing

Hi Mark,




Great speaking with you today — I wanted to send over a quick recap of everything we covered, along with a clear breakdown of what RetargetIQ includes.





What RetargetIQ Gives You





Here’s a summary of the full suite of capabilities built into the platform:



1. Website Visitor Identification

Identify previously anonymous website traffic and match those visitors to enriched consumer or business profiles.



2. Direct Mail Automation

Trigger personalized direct mail pieces based on user behavior, location, or custom targeting rules.



3. Intent Data – B2B

Access real-time business-level intent signals (company behaviors, research patterns, buying signals) to fuel outbound and advertising campaigns.



4. Intent Data – B2C

Tap into consumer intent data streams tied to research activity, buying behaviors, IP/device signals, and 200+ data sources.



5. Static Identity Graph (B2B Directory Pool)

Our large static B2B data set—comparable to Apollo or ZoomInfo—giving you firmographic profiles, contacts, and company data enriched and ready to export.



Together, these components give you one unified system for prospecting, enrichment, retargeting, and identity resolution across both B2B and B2C audiences.





Pricing & Grandfathered Offer





As mentioned on the call:



Our Black Friday deal is $497/month, and that price is locked in for life as long as you activate before the deadline.
This includes unlimited usage across all modules of the platform.
Once our AI Search feature is released (could be tomorrow or sometime next week), pricing moves to $997/month and we introduce usage-based record caps with tiered plans.
You can “wait and gamble” if you want — if AI Search slips to next Friday and you purchase before then, you’d still get the $497 rate.
However, the only price we can guarantee is the $497 plan through end of day this Friday (Pacific Standard Time).






API Documentation





If you want to look under the hood, you can find our full Enterprise API documentation directly on our website.

Just scroll to the footer and click “API” — it will open everything you need.





Next Steps





If you’d like to move forward and lock in the $497 grandfathered plan, let me know and I’ll send over your private Stripe payment link.

Once that’s completed, we’ll create your account immediately and send your login credentials shortly after.



Let me know if you have any questions or if you’d like to get started.



Best,

Nate

Hi Nate, how many US homeowners do you have total on the US list? And will
it be fine if I skiptrace and download the entirety of the US in a month
(or however long it takes)? I just want to make sure there aren't any
hidden limitations.

We have roughly 3/4 of the US population mapped.

There are no hidden limitations. Only limitation is cap of 1M records per query. But you can pull as many queries as you want. And do it by batches or zip codes or states or cities. 

Thanks

Alright I'd like to proceed. Can you send 2 payment links (around $250

Hey Anton.

Let me know once you take care of these so we can create and send over your 
login.

Price will also soon be increasing to $997/m once our ai search is 
released. So we can honor the grandfathered $497/m price until Thursday end 
of day.

Not exactly sure. My guess is you probably saw one of our ads and booked a
call through our website.

Here is a synopsis of what we do just in case it rings a bell.

-Unlimited website identification
-unlimited email enrichment
-unlimited mobile enrichment
-unlimited b2b lists
-unlimited b2b intent data
-unlimited b2c intent data

(Not a single tool on the market that does even one of these unlimited for
flat rate)

If this was an accident no worries. If this is something you think would
merit a conversation or you want to see a demo of it in action just let me
know and we can throw a time on the calendar.

SUBJECT: Re: Data Platform

Hi Nate,

Thank you for the meeting today!  I learned a lot.

Our first order of business is being able to enrich B2B data that we 
already have.  Most often we have at least a business name, address, and 
phone number (NAP data).

We want to bump that against what you have to append owner data, employee 
data, LinkedIn, email addresses, mobile numbers etc.

Now that you know the model and a HYBRID of YELP for example, we have both 
B2B and B2C needs.

I really liked how you talked about having the Fingerprint Pixel data from 
our website being able to trigger an email or a postcard going out the door 
on an automated basis.  Would like to learn more about that as well.

When I get owner mobile phone data, we like to drop a ringless voicemail to 
them which works well too.

BTW, below are several recent Press Releases that will help you to know our 
company.

Hi Nate,

Thank you for the meeting today!  I learned a lot.

Our first order of business is being able to enrich B2B data that we 
already have.  Most often we have at least a business name, address, and 
phone number (NAP data).

We want to bump that against what you have to append owner data, employee 
data, LinkedIn, email addresses, mobile numbers etc.

Now that you know the model and a HYBRID of YELP for example, we have both 
B2B and B2C needs.

I really liked how you talked about having the Fingerprint Pixel data from 
our website being able to trigger an email or a postcard going out the door 
on an automated basis.  Would like to learn more about that as well.

When I get owner mobile phone data, we like to drop a ringless voicemail to 
them which works well too.

BTW, below are several recent Press Releases that will help you to know our 
company.

Hi Nate,

Got caught up in the Thanksgiving Holiday.

I would like to have another call to determine something I want to do that 
I think Retarget IQ can do that would attach to all of my Merchants.  Would 
be a very big project.

Hoping we can talk through it for validation and then how we snap it all 
together.

Enjoy the rest of your Tuesday.

Hoping we can talk through it for validation and then how we snap it all

Hi Nate,

Thank you for the meeting today!  I learned a lot.

Our first order of business is being able to enrich B2B data that we 
already have.  Most often we have at least a business name, address, and 
phone number (NAP data).

We want to bump that against what you have to append owner data, employee 
data, LinkedIn, email addresses, mobile numbers etc.

Now that you know the model and a HYBRID of YELP for example, we have both 
B2B and B2C needs.

I really liked how you talked about having the Fingerprint Pixel data from 
our website being able to trigger an email or a postcard going out the door 
on an automated basis.  Would like to learn more about that as well.

When I get owner mobile phone data, we like to drop a ringless voicemail to 
them which works well too.

BTW, below are several recent Press Releases that will help you to know our 
company.

SUBJECT: Re: Data Platform

Hello Nate,

That sounds great that they feel they can do something like that.

As you know, we are a LOCAL Search directory and are acquiring Brick & 
Mortar type Merchant clients across the US.

We provide client/customer/patient acquisition for them from our pool of 
Members nationwide.

We have a unique ecosystem and most of it is exclusive both for Merchants 
and Members.

We are building an app called DataSmart360 which will operate much like an 
Active Campaign on steroids.  Think of it like a communication hub for 
customer engagement (email, SMS etc.).

Merchants will be entering their customer data within it.  Typically they 
would have a name and email and perhaps a phone number.  We want to enrich 
this data for them and append things like whether they are a homeowner, 
have kids, life selects etc.  

So perhaps there could be an API on a timer that could grab this Merchant 
customer data and bump it up against your sources and then add it to my 
Merchant customer record.

It might be interesting, and over time I might be able to provide Retarget 
IQ with data that I glean over time that might enrich your data too.

See below for a summary of how we work with Merchants (GRC stands for 
Grocery Rebate Certificate):

Ya we do direct mail also. Email there are a few routes either using back 
tools like klyavio, server etc or if wanting to ensure optimal 
deliverability can do it thru cold email software such as 
instantly/smartlead.

We can go over this stuff on a call this week for sure.

Hey Troy,

Talked to one of our developers today about how you were planning to use 
the tool. Will be really easy to do waterfall style enrichment. 

If you want to send over that info you mentioned and we can put something

Enjoy your weekend.

Hi Nate,

Thank you for the meeting today!  I learned a lot.

Our first order of business is being able to enrich B2B data that we 
already have.  Most often we have at least a business name, address, and 
phone number (NAP data).

We want to bump that against what you have to append owner data, employee 
data, LinkedIn, email addresses, mobile numbers etc.

Now that you know the model and a HYBRID of YELP for example, we have both 
B2B and B2C needs.

I really liked how you talked about having the Fingerprint Pixel data from 
our website being able to trigger an email or a postcard going out the door 
on an automated basis.  Would like to learn more about that as well.

When I get owner mobile phone data, we like to drop a ringless voicemail to 
them which works well too.

BTW, below are several recent Press Releases that will help you to know our 
company.

together.

Enjoy the rest of your Tuesday.

Hi Nate,

Thank you for the meeting today!  I learned a lot.

Our first order of business is being able to enrich B2B data that we 
already have.  Most often we have at least a business name, address, and 
phone number (NAP data).

We want to bump that against what you have to append owner data, employee 
data, LinkedIn, email addresses, mobile numbers etc.

Now that you know the model and a HYBRID of YELP for example, we have both 
B2B and B2C needs.

I really liked how you talked about having the Fingerprint Pixel data from 
our website being able to trigger an email or a postcard going out the door 
on an automated basis.  Would like to learn more about that as well.

When I get owner mobile phone data, we like to drop a ringless voicemail to 
them which works well too.

BTW, below are several recent Press Releases that will help you to know our 
company.

Hey Troy,

Thanks for your time today. As mentioned that $497/m grandfathered-in price

If you have any examples of how you are wanting to utilize the data let us 
know and we can help point you in the right direction in terms of 
implementation.

Hey Troy,

Thanks for your time today. As mentioned that $497/m grandfathered-in price 
point is valid for 7 days from today.

If you have any examples of how you are wanting to utilize the data let us 
know and we can help point you in the right direction in terms of 
implementation.


Thanks

Ya we do direct mail also. Email there are a few routes either using back 
tools like klyavio, server etc or if wanting to ensure optimal 
deliverability can do it thru cold email software such as 
instantly/smartlead.

We can go over this stuff on a call this week for sure.

Hey Troy,

Talked to one of our developers today about how you were planning to use 
the tool. Will be really easy to do waterfall style enrichment. 

If you want to send over that info you mentioned and we can put something

Enjoy your weekend.

Hi Nate,

Got caught up in the Thanksgiving Holiday.

I would like to have another call to determine something I want to do that

Hoping we can talk through it for validation and then how we snap it all

Hi Nate,

Thank you for the meeting today!  I learned a lot.

Our first order of business is being able to enrich B2B data that we 
already have.  Most often we have at least a business name, address, and 
phone number (NAP data).

We want to bump that against what you have to append owner data, employee 
data, LinkedIn, email addresses, mobile numbers etc.

Now that you know the model and a HYBRID of YELP for example, we have both 
B2B and B2C needs.

I really liked how you talked about having the Fingerprint Pixel data from 
our website being able to trigger an email or a postcard going out the door 
on an automated basis.  Would like to learn more about that as well.

When I get owner mobile phone data, we like to drop a ringless voicemail to 
them which works well too.

BTW, below are several recent Press Releases that will help you to know our 
company.

I would like to have another call to determine something I want to do that

Hoping we can talk through it for validation and then how we snap it all

Hi Nate,

Thank you for the meeting today!  I learned a lot.

Our first order of business is being able to enrich B2B data that we 
already have.  Most often we have at least a business name, address, and 
phone number (NAP data).

We want to bump that against what you have to append owner data, employee 
data, LinkedIn, email addresses, mobile numbers etc.

Now that you know the model and a HYBRID of YELP for example, we have both 
B2B and B2C needs.

I really liked how you talked about having the Fingerprint Pixel data from 
our website being able to trigger an email or a postcard going out the door 
on an automated basis.  Would like to learn more about that as well.

When I get owner mobile phone data, we like to drop a ringless voicemail to 
them which works well too.

BTW, below are several recent Press Releases that will help you to know our 
company.

Ya we do direct mail also. Email there are a few routes either using back 
tools like klyavio, server etc or if wanting to ensure optimal 
deliverability can do it thru cold email software such as 
instantly/smartlead.

We can go over this stuff on a call this week for sure.

Thanks

Hey Nate,

P.S. Did I hear you say in our first call that you have backend providers 
that can trigger emails and postcards?  I would have an interest in that 
for our B2B side is why I ask.

Hey Troy,

Talked to one of our developers today about how you were planning to use 
the tool. Will be really easy to do waterfall style enrichment. 

If you want to send over that info you mentioned and we can put something 
on the calendar for next week.

Enjoy your weekend.

Hi Nate,

Got caught up in the Thanksgiving Holiday.

I would like to have another call to determine something I want to do that 
I think Retarget IQ can do that would attach to all of my Merchants.  Would 
be a very big project.

Hoping we can talk through it for validation and then how we snap it all 
together.

Enjoy the rest of your Tuesday.

Hi Nate,

Thank you for the meeting today!  I learned a lot.

Our first order of business is being able to enrich B2B data that we 
already have.  Most often we have at least a business name, address, and 
phone number (NAP data).

We want to bump that against what you have to append owner data, employee 
data, LinkedIn, email addresses, mobile numbers etc.

Now that you know the model and a HYBRID of YELP for example, we have both 
B2B and B2C needs.

I really liked how you talked about having the Fingerprint Pixel data from 
our website being able to trigger an email or a postcard going out the door 
on an automated basis.  Would like to learn more about that as well.

When I get owner mobile phone data, we like to drop a ringless voicemail to 
them which works well too.

BTW, below are several recent Press Releases that will help you to know our 
company.

If you have any examples of how you are wanting to utilize the data let us

implementation.
