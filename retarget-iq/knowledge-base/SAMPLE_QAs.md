## Audience Creation & Targeting

### Q: How do I search so that I get actual b2b saas companies?

**A:** For B2B SaaS, make sure you are filtering by the right SIC codes or industry terms in the B2B Intent section. That should tighten up the results significantly.

How are you searching/pulling the list currently?

### Q: If you want to add more topics, that's a separate audience each time? Is there a way to combine audiences? Or only via export?

**A:** Currently you can search by one topic at a time but upon releasing our V2 platform we are planning to have multi search enabled along with specific search terms that people are looking for ie "roofers near me" or "best plumbers near me" etc.

Please let me know if this makes sense!

### Q: Perhaps I configured this improperly? My Facebook Audience did not update today

**A:** Had our engineering team check it should be working fine it looks like. We checked your account.

Let us know if you have any other issues

## Data Enrichment & Pulls

### Q: Do you guys do unlimited credits?

**A:** Yep! We do not have any limitations in terms of how many lists/audiences you can create. You can create as many audience lists as you want! The only limitation is you can only pull 1 million at a time per list.

**Source:** email-19bd3d91

---

### Q: Sounds like it's best to always have that checked off to get max data?

**A:** Correct! If you want to maximize the data/records you are pulling, I would have all these filters checked in the "Email Validation" category. That'll give you the biggest pool of records to work with!

**Source:** email-19be17c8

---

### Q: Can you confirm the system is set up to pull user data?

**A:** Yes. I can confirm that! It is 100% set up so once people start visiting your website, you should be able to see visitors start populating shortly after! We use a SHA-256 encryption for the hash which is what Meta and Google use for their targeting. This allows for the best match rate when it comes to targeting your website visitors or uploading this data to your CRM/email list!

## White Label Setup

### Q: You have a video of the white label? You mentioned you could send one to me

**A:** Here are videos that walk through the entire platform features/walkthrough.

Here is the white label demo

### Q: Does it look basically the same way as my dashboard looks? If yes, then I am in

**A:** Yes! Your white label will look exactly the same as your current dashboard. The only differences will be:

1. Your custom domain (instead of app.retargetiq.com)
2. Your logo in the top left corner
3. Your brand colors (optional)
4. Each sub-account gets their own login credentials

Everything else functions exactly the same!

## Pixel/Tracking Integration

### Q: Do you have a timeline for when you can have your Pixel integrated with GTM (Google Tag Manager)?

**A:** We are working on this now and plan to have it ready by mid-February with the V2 release. In the meantime, you can still install the pixel directly on your site by pasting the code in the header section.

## API & Technical

### Q: Can you please provide a publicly accessible API endpoint URL? Or is there an IP whitelist I need to be added to?

**A:** Here is our API documentation:
https://api.retargetiq.com/docs

You do not need to be whitelisted. The API is publicly accessible, you just need your API key which you can generate from your dashboard under Settings > API Access.

**Source:** email-19c033f0

---

### Q: How does API work?

**A:** So if you wanted to, this is available on the bottom of our website, you could look at it right now. This allows for you to actually make API calls direct to our system. So if you wanted to just create a flow that actually has no one in the platform, let's say besides setting up the initial queries, you could do that and just have us as a pass through.

## Pricing & Plans

### Q: Can you give me a sense for pricing on: 1) White label 2) Single license 3) API access

**A:** Here's our current pricing structure:

**Single License:**
- Monthly: $750/month
- Quarterly: $500/month ($1,500 upfront)
- Annual: Best pricing (contact for quote)

**White Label:**
- Starting at $4,000/month
- Includes unlimited sub-accounts
- Custom branding and domain
- Priority support

**API Access:**
- $249/month add-on to any license
- Currently no rate limits (reasonable use)
- Full documentation provided

**Important:** Lock in V1 pricing before Feb 6th to avoid 50-75% price increase when V2 launches on Feb 15th.

### Q: Can you confirm this isn't the case with you? (referring to competitor limits)

**A:** I can 100% confirm we do NOT limit you on:
- Number of audiences you can create
- Number of times you can refresh/update audiences
- Number of records per audience (except 1M per query max)

Unlike our competitors, we believe you should be able to test, explore, and innovate without artificial constraints.

## Product Capabilities & Features

### Q: What makes Retarget IQ different from competitors?

**A:** Our technical co founder began his partnership with Fortune 100 companies as well as a publicly traded data company that we partnered with. Through that 15 year relationship, he built out essentially the tool, the technology that we have today. What happened about two years ago is we were able to get a contract with this publicly traded data company which unfortunately I can't disclose the name, but we'll talk about them, where we actually are able to tap into their entire intent database and pass it to you. We are one of less than three people in the world that can be able to do this.

### Q: How does Intent Data work?

**A:** This is our visitor identification. So these are all people that landed on the website, right? This is one of our finance partners. They just let us use their account because they have theories that they have preset that they just use that for the last few months. They literally just sit back, relax, and it literally just updates every single day. Their intent data that sends to their meta, sends to their Google and sends to their CRM. So they literally set up a handful of audiences and then they just sat back and relaxed because it was so accurate and it was so consistently reducing meta costs.

### Q: What's your current CAC look like?

**A:** I have to double check, but we're literally paying about, I think, eight bucks a conversion.

**Why?** Because we're targeting so well. We picked up on your intent for either Audience Lab, Zoom Info, or Apollo, and we saw our booked meetings. We're doing it in single digits for costs for conversions.

**Source:** call-transcript-aaron-s

---

### Q: Do you know when the search term will be implemented?

**A:** The exact keyword search feature is planned for V2 launch on February 15th. This will allow you to search for specific phrases like "roofers near me" or "best plumbers in [city]" instead of just broad topic categories.

**Source:** email-19becd84

---

### Q: Can you share the definition or how "score_category" is generated?

**A:** The score_category field represents the intent level:
- **Low:** Grade B - decent intent, worth nurturing
- **Medium:** Grade A - strong intent, good target
- **High:** Grade A+ - very high intent, prioritize these

We look at someone's consistent behaviors and what they're doing, and this can actually map to our own repository of information that then allows for us to look at that as an intent signal. We are able to then essentially grade them.

## Integrations

### Q: How does Integrations work?

**A:** We do have integrations already established with HubSpot, Go High Level, Salesforce, Fresh Sales, Quavio and Mailchimp, Beehive, Pipedrive and many, many more. We're launching in V2, which launches February 15th. We're adding additional integrations. If there's any specific ones that you currently leverage that you need, that you want to see if we have, just ping me with them. I'll ask our technical co founder and we can let you know if we're going to have those established.

## Key Sales Talking Points (from Call Transcript)

### On Data Quality
"I always like to joke, technically we have better data than a publicly traded company because we add even more data to their already established data repository. Nike uses this data. HomeGoods uses this data. Every Fortune 100 company you can think of leverages this because it's the best."

### On Limitations
"We don't cap you on audiences, we don't cap you on how many updates you do, we don't cap you on records. The only thing that we cap is each query poll. You can do at most a million, which we always say, I don't know why you're pulling a million people when you want to be more granular and targeted when it comes to your outreach or your ads."

### On Meta Targeting
"We have such a great match rate on the SHA256, for example, which is column A here, that our Targeting Andromeda's AI within meta is so powerful that we on average see customers have their costs for ads [cut in half] and double their Conversions."

### On Intent Data Timeframe
"We only like to look at the last two weeks of intent data. There's two reasons for that. Transparently, we believe that that's the best time frame in which someone's buying journey is typically if someone is showing intent for a continuous period."

### On Pricing Philosophy
"I'd rather you say, john, I need to pay to upgrade because I'm ready to use this now. That makes me a lot happier than you coming to me being like, why did you sell me this? Because that doesn't feel genuine."
