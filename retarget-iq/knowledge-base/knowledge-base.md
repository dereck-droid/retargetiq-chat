## Audience Creation & Targeting

### We’ve access to the API but does it only provide visitors details or it can
query the info as in the spreadsheet to filter by category or topic in
order to get output of B2B or B2C leads info?

We’re looking for the latter part

**Answer:** Currently only website visitor info. Upon release of V2 (planned for Feb 
15th launch date) will also be able to do all query and audience data pulls 
completely automated fully thru api.

**Source:** email-19c033f0

### Perhaps I configured this improperly? My Facebook Audience did not update
today

**Answer:** Had our engineering team check it should be working fine it looks like. We checked your account.

Let us know if you have any other issues

**Source:** email-19bebee0

---

### How do I search so that I get actual b2b saas companies

**Answer:** For B2B SaaS, make sure you are filtering by the right SIC codes or
industry terms in the B2B Intent section. That should tighten up the
results significantly.

How are you searching/pulling the list currently?

**Source:** email-19bf1f9e

---

### If you want to add more topics, that's a separate audience each time? Is
there a way to combine audiences? Or only via export?

Sorry for all the questions

**Answer:** Currently you can search by one topic at a time but upon releasing our V2
platform we are planning to have multi search enabled along with specific
search terms that people are looking for ie "roofers near me" or "best
plumbers near me" etc.

Please let me know if this makes sense!

**Source:** email-19becd84

---

### Do you guys
also do that?

Greg

**Answer:** I would be happy to speak to our dev team about this as I do know they are
planning to release exact keywords just as audience lab did with their V2
platform release coming up here in the next two weeks. Let me see what
update I can get from them on these topics!

**Source:** email-19be6d45

---

### Another request I might have is: can we get a list of all of
the keywords you have so we can use that to study and use AI to help us
pick audiences for our searches? We're not just searching in the dark

**Answer:** No problem, here is a full list of up to date searches -

**Source:** email-19be6d45

---

### Where's the documentation / knowledge base?

I'm specifically looking for the FB integration where i can send my RIQ
audience to a FB audience so that I can share that with an ads manager

**Answer:** I would manually download these lists and have your ads manager manually
upload them until we release our V2 platform that will allow you to hook
these into your meta account. Please let me know if you have any issues
downloading the lists!

**Source:** email-19bca1ac

---

### If so,
could you please share how to do that or point me to the steps?

Thanks in advance for your help!

**Answer:** Totally. Drop the drop down list of filters. Select zip code then select condition “in” and you can either list zip codes out separated by a comma or just put all (or have Chat gpt) put all the zip codes in a excel or CSV file. One zip code per cell going down column 1 of excel sheet (one zip code per cell)

### Other dilemma that I have right now is I still
need to filter out DNC contacts on the list that is being exported on
Retarget, is there a way for me to filter this out before exporting?

**Answer:** Not right now on the DNC side.

Standard practice is to run your lists thru DNC list.

### one last thing, are there limits to how many 'audiences' one can build or
how many records i can grab from each audience?

also, it would be great to know if you are able to find ecomm brands

**Answer:** Its unlimited audiences and records currently. Very soon this is going to
change. For ecom it's best to use ecom list building best practice in the
industry which is pulling list of ecom stores with store leads then take
all those domains it gives you and enrich it with our tool for decision
makers, their emails and their mobile numbers.

### Danny are you guys free Tuesday afternoon for us to show you the website identification tool with all your actual data in it?


Best
Nate Calhoun

**Answer:** I don’t think Nate saw your previous email come through when he emailed
you.

The Audience Builder lets you pull unlimited B2B data that is the same as
Apollo or Zoominfo but it is an unlimited list for the $497 instead of
having to pay $200 for 10k people and have it be limited.

### I do have a concern that RetargetIQ is not yet able to API integrate with Meta-   Can you advise as to when this will happen?
 
I want to be sure I understand where your platform stands with this integration, and can you share a list of all integrations Retarget IQ currently can align, as well as a future state of upcoming integrations and when those will go live

**Answer:** Thanks for the note — really appreciate you sharing your interest in moving
forward.

Great timing as well, as I just received an update on this. We are
releasing a *native Meta audience integration* that allows you to push
audiences directly from RetargetIQ into Meta Ads *within the platform* (no
manual exports required). This is scheduled to go live *next week*. Once
live, you’ll be able to build, refresh, and sync audiences natively.

**Source:** email-19bc7f67

---

### Can you explain how this process works and if there’s anything I need to do on my end?

Thank you in advance for your help

**Answer:** you basically create an intent audience. Then go to all audiences click preview and click download all and name the file. Then go to saved queries in the dropdown and schedule it to run daily or at whatever interval you want. Then daily whenever you want fresh data you just login and download the file and manually upload it to a Facebook custom audience.

Ccing in Cindy to help with additional support if needed so please reply all to threads.

### How does Super Pixel work?

**Answer:** We have our licenses that would essentially allow for you to control and manage every element of the data discovery, be it with our Super Pixel or your audience building.

## Data Enrichment & Pulls

### How are you searching/pulling the list currently?

Any intent topics or static data?


Thanks
Cindy

**Answer:** Can you share a loom of you pulling the list you are trying to pull and
please as well mention in the video what list/criteria you are trying to
pull. Our platform is mainly an intent data platform but you can still pull
static lists. We have the same exact data and provider that zoom info uses.
So this will just help us figure out what is off in the search parameters.
To be honest a lot of tools such as zoom info and or apollo.io are
difficult to pull Saas or ecommerce businesses via search dude to that
being a classification of business but curious how you are doing it. So I
can help.

**Answer:** Curious if the client can pull this and if so how?

### Sounds like it's best to always have that checked off to get max data?

Cary

**Answer:** It’s just b2c don’t care about business info or associated companies. Where 
b2b companies do. So most b2b companies use that toggle and b2c companies 
don’t usually want any of that other data.

busy for everyone.

### How does Intent Data work?

**Answer:** So this is where we're generating a lot of our intent data, is looking at someone's consistent behaviors and what they're doing and Then this can actually map to our own repository of information that then allows for us to look at that as an intent signal.

**Answer:** No worries, I was under the impression that we would be able to put a log
in link or something of that nature on our website where users are able to
come to our site and immediately log into the datashopper white label
platform. But I’m not sure if we can integrate that in a special way or if
we can just link it to our white label platform?

### You have a video of the white label? You mentioned you could send one to 
show a potential client and just get rid of your logo

**Answer:** Good question — and I just want to clarify expectations upfront.

We don’t currently have a demo video of the platform with our branding
removed. The reason for that is that the *white-label environment only
exists once you’re actually set up as a white-label partner*.

**Source:** email-19bc32bc

---

### Does it look basically the same way as my dashboard looks? If yes, then I 
can just kinda show a demo that way

**Answer:** Yes, it does. But once white labeled it will have your branding and colors
and logo. Also we are having the biggest update in a year to our platform
and data coming shortly in the next few weeks the release of our V2
Platform. Which is going to allow even more integrations, better
email/phone verification, even cleaner interface etc.

### How does White Label work?

What type of enrichments do you have? Think of leadmagic, findymail,
prospeo as competitors since thats what i use now

I dont mind having to verify leads but can i export big chunks of data at
once?

And any other relevant info u have about exports limits/enrichment

**Answer:** Yes the only cap is on 1 specific list pull it caps at 1,000,000 records 
just so people don’t pull the entire data base. All can be done thru API 
also (api docs linked on our website).

Any sort of enrichment. For mobile numbers or personal address basically 
any field.

**Answer:** I hope you have been doing well! As per our last conversation I know it has

### Can you give me a sense for pricing on:


  1

**Answer:** Want to clarify on your second bullet point regarding data appends for 
members where you have email, name phone. Are you referring to enriching 
that list for other normal data like address etc. Or are you referring to 
the financial soft pull for that.

**Source:** email-19a19900

---

### Are you referring to enriching that list for other normal data like address etc

**Answer:** Could you give us an idea of the quantity you would be doing this at on a 
monthly basis. This price varies directly on quantity. With quantity the 
price comes down per pull.

Also I want to mention there are two different pulls

**Source:** email-19a19900

### Can you confirm this isn't the case with you?

for free but I can see that they have a ton of records. Would you like me

## Product Capabilities & Features

### Can you share the definition or how "score_category" is generated?
What metric is used to get that score?

Thanks

**Answer:** That score category is based on intent signals we are seeing for that
visitor, and we have a new algorithm that deciphers how much intent there
actually is.
For example, a user that lands on this page would be deemed as high intent
for refinancing:
https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/refinance-rates/

In our new V2 model this will become be a numerical score 0-100

### What topic would I select if I want to target companies searching for website development services?

Seth

**Answer:** Great question — this one’s pretty straightforward once you think about how
intent works.

The *intent topic* is simply the signal for what a company is actively
showing interest in.

know what you want to do. Either way works.
