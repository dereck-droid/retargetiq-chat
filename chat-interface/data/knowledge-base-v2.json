Medium intent is an A - strong buying signals. High intent is an A+ - the person has shown repeated, sustained interest and is very likely to purchase soon.

This results in better data accuracy, match rates over 90% for Meta ads, and more complete behavioral intent signals.

The recommendation is to run phone numbers through the Do Not Call list and use a cheap verification service before calling.

If someone makes a purchase, their intent signal typically disappears from the next pull. You can schedule queries to run as frequently as daily to capture new intent signals.",

          "answer": "After logging in, go to the Websites section, add your domain, and the platform generates a pixel code. Copy the code and paste it in the header section of your website (before the closing </head> tag). For platforms like WordPress, Shopify, or Wix, you can use the header injection area. The pixel usually starts capturing data within a few hours.",

          "answer": "Identification rates range from 40-70% depending on traffic source and cookie permissions. SEO/organic traffic typically sees 40-50% identification. Paid traffic from ads often sees 50-60%. The variation depends on cookie consent rates and whether visitors have opted into tracking on other websites in the data network.",

This works through cookie permissions and cross-site tracking technology. Pricing for competitor pixels is still being finalized, but high-traffic sites will have different pricing than low-traffic sites.",

          "question": "Should I add multiple intent topics to one audience?",
          "answer": "No. It's better to create separate audiences for each intent topic and test them individually. Adding multiple topics doesn't increase intent scores - it broadens your audience and may dilute targeting. If you want people interested in multiple topics, create separate audiences and find the overlap using CSV exports or API.",
